# Upload Email HTML Templates

The Upload Email HTML Templates feature enables marketers to easily import email designs packaged as ZIP files directly into CleverTap. These ZIP files typically contain a single HTML file and associated image assets, enabling efficient template creation without manual image uploads. You can upload templates not only from the What step of the campaign setup but also from the _Templates_ section of CMS.

With this feature, you can:

- Faster template creation by uploading a pre-packaged HTML + assets ZIP file
- Automated asset management with image upload to CMS
- Improved compatibility with email assets created in third-party tools
- Reduces manual errors in HTML and image linkage
