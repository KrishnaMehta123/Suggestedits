# Email Add-On

The Email Add-on offers you preview across devices and inboxes before you send out the campaign. It also allows you to test your email for deliverability by creating a spam report. The Email Add-On offers you 300 email previews and spam reports a month. 

Before we begin, check that you have enabled the Inbox Previews. For enabling the Inbox Previews, see [Enable Email Previews](doc:enabling-previews).

## Step 5: Enable Inbox Previews (Optional)

You can now preview your email across devices and inboxes before you send out the campaign. This will help you to understand how your email will be displayed on devices such as desktop or mobile, and email clients such as Gmail, Yahoo, and so on.

>
> Check that you have enabled email previews. For more information, see [enabling previews](https://docs.clevertap.com/docs/enabling-previews).
>
> Email previews are available only if you have opted for the email add-on from CleverTap.

When you click “Previews”, a popup window with “Devices” and “Inbox” tabs will appear. 

Under “Devices” you can view desktop and mobile previews.

Under “Inboxes”, you can check previews across various email clients.  

You can generate previews for various email clients by clicking the 'Run Tests' button in the preview window.\
Each of these preview thumbnails can be clicked and viewed on a full scale.\
You can also reload the preview images.

You will find the email clients listed under CleverTap > Settings > Email > Setup Previews.

At this stage, you can continue the campaign creation flow or save the message draft. If you save a draft, the previews will also be saved and regenerated when you open the draft again.

## Step 6: Check the Spam Report (Optional)

You will likely want to ensure the deliverability of emails to your users. The spam report feature helps to determine the probability of the email message landing in a spam folder. You can check the spam report of your message at this stage after entering the sender details.

After you enter sender details, click the 'Spam Report' button to check the spam report of your email, or continue building the campaign.  You will see a detailed report on your email message and a warning if the message does not pass any spam filter.
