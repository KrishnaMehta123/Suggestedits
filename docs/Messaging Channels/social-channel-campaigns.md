**[WhatsApp](doc:whatsapp)**

WhatsApp is a channel that enables secure and trustworthy peer to peer communications. The most attractive value that WhatsApp provides is that unlike other channels, it's advertisement and spam free. Recently, WhatsApp has started allowing businesses to engage with their users in the same manner as they (users) will talk to their friends and families.

CleverTap allows you to use WhatsApp as a channel to engage their users in a trustworthy and secure way. CleverTap also allows you to seamlessly chat with each one of their users to deliver quick responses to the service requests.
