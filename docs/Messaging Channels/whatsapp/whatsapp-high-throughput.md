WhatsApp currently permits sending 80-150 messages per second per phone number. This can be a bottleneck for big businesses when they need to reach a large user base rapidly. For example, reach all subscribers with food combo offers during a Super Bowl game. 

To address this issue, there are two following solutions:

- WhatsApp allows certain customers to boost their default speed from 150 to 1000 messages per second. 
- WhatsApp suggests that businesses connect multiple phone numbers within a single account. This will allow businesses to split the message across multiple numbers and reach the users simultaneously, increasing reach and speed. 

CleverTap BSP combines both methods to provide high message throughput as a distinguishing feature for our large enterprise clients. For example, a business can send 1000 messages X 10 phone numbers, that is 10,000 messages per second or 600,000 messages per minute.

## High Throughput in WhatsApp Campaigns
