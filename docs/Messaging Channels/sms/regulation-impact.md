The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) requires distributed ledger technology (DLT) registration for all the service providers for bulk SMS services in India. Starting on February 1, 2021, it is mandatory to send messages to customers via a pre-approved template. For more information regarding DLT registration, refer to [SMS Regulations](doc:sms-regulations). 

#What This Means to Our Clients
This requires the following changes from your side when you create an SMS campaign on the CleverTap dashboard. 
[block:callout]
{
  "type": "danger",
  "title": "Template IDs",
  "body": "For the SMS campaigns targeted to Indian mobile numbers and having MSG-91 as the service provider, a template ID always needs to be added. For other service providers, a template ID may or may not be required. We recommend checking with your service provider."
}
[/block]
##Future Campaigns
Future campaigns are the campaigns that have started after February 1, 2021.

When you create campaigns after the mandated date, you must use a pre-approved template. In the campaign setup where you choose a service provider, we now provide an extra field to provide a template ID.

        "#f8f8f9"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
[/block]
This field is optional because it is only required for sending SMS messages to phone numbers in India. Check that you provide a matching template ID every time you create an SMS campaign for customers in India. 

For generic service providers, you can edit the settings to additionally set up a key-value pair as shown below:
  * Key: This indicates the name of the key for a template ID your service provider is expecting you to send. In the example shown below 'content_id' is the name of the key expected by the service provider.
  * Value: Specify $$TemplateId. You can enter the value of the template ID at the time of the campaign creation.

For example, if the key name for a template ID is expected as content_id.
