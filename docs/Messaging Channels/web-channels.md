This section covers various types of web channels including web push, web pop-up, and web exit intent.

##[Web Push](doc:web-push)##
Web push notifications are browser-based messages you can send to your desktop or mobile web users even when they are not currently visiting your website. Web push notifications operate in a similar way as mobile push notifications except the platform being targeted is the user’s desktop or mobile browser.

##[Web Pop-up](doc:web-pop-ups)##
Web pop-ups are interstitials messages that are displayed to the user while they are on your desktop or mobile website.

##[Web Exit Intent](doc:web-exit-intent)##
Exit intents are similar to web pop-ups except they are triggered when a user goes to navigate away from your website.
