Remarketing with Google Ads is a great way to re-engage with users outside of your app or website.

> 👍 Remarketing Example
>
> Some users visit your app and view a pair of shoes called *New shiny shoes*. You can re-engage all such users who viewed this product on all of Google channels such as Google search, Gmail, or Youtube based on your Google subscription plan. Now when these users visit Google, they will see ads for your *New shiny shoes* product.

The “Google Ads” remarketing module on the CleverTap dashboard (under “Campaigns”) is easy to set up for all your users or distinct user segments. These segments can be created by past user behavior, user properties, or a combination of past user behavior and properties. 

> 📘 Note
>
> Before you begin, check that you have integrated your Google Ads account with your CleverTap account from Settings>Integration>Remarketing. For more information on integration, see [Google Ads Integration](https://docs.clevertap.com/docs/google-adwords-remarketing)

## Select a Campaign Type

Select **when** the campaign must be delivered. 

Past behavior campaigns can be scheduled to run:

* On a specific date and time.
* On multiple specified dates and times.
* Recurring at the intervals that you can define.

> 📘 Note
>
> If you specify a recurring day for a campaign, say the 7th of each month, then the campaign will start for the specified day and ignore the creation date. This is a precaution to avoid sending a campaign unintentionally on a prior date.

## Select the Segment

Select the users **who** will receive your remarketing campaign. You can select the target users based on past user behavior and/or user properties. You can also create an ad-hoc segment if the saved segments do not meet your requirements. These are the users who you can target for remarketing via Google.
