Remarketing with Google Ads is a great way to re-engage with users outside of your app or website.

For example, some users visit your app and view a pair of shoes called 'new shiny shoes'. You can re-engage all such users who viewed this product on all of Google channels such as Google search, Gmail, or Youtube based on your Google subscription plan. Now, when these users visit Google, they will see ads for your product, that is, 'new shiny shoes'. 

The “Google Ads” remarketing module on the CleverTap dashboard (under “Campaigns”) is easy to set up for all your users or distinct user segments. These segments can be created by past user behavior, user properties, or a combination of past user behavior and properties.
