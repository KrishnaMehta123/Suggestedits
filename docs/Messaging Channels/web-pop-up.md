# Overview

Web popup messages are notifications that are displayed on desktop or mobile websites when a user is actively surfing a web page. CleverTap's Web Popup channel allows you to send quick alerts, offers, or how-to byte-sized content to your customers using the built-in web popup builder or your own custom HTML templates.

CleverTap offers two types of web pop-ups:

* **Simple web pop-up notifications**: You can use these templates to create your notifications including a box notification, a banner notification, and an interstitial notification.
* **Exit intent notifications**: These notifications are displayed before the user exits your site. These are only available for desktops. Read about [web exit-intent pop-ups](doc:web-exit-intent-overview) to learn more.

> 🚧 Prerequisite
>
> The prerequisite to set up web popup campaigns is to integrate your website with the CleverTap JavaScript plugin. For more information, refer to [Web](https://developer.clevertap.com/docs/web) in the developer documentation.

The *Web Popup* feature makes it easy to set up web popup campaigns for all your users or specific user segments. 

These segments are created based on either of the following ways:

* User action on one of your web pages
* User visiting one of your specific web pages
* User visiting your website via any referral web page
* Number of your web pages a user has visited so far in their session

After sending the campaign, you can view detailed reports on how many messages were sent, how many users converted as a result, and so on.
