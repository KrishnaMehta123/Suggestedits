# Overview

The customer experience is an important factor for a last-mile delivery business. The last-mile delivery businesses can improve the customer experience with the CleverTap Direct Call while uplifting their retention rates. Following are some examples of how Direct Call can solve your business challenges. 

# Use Case

**Challenge** - A user orders from a food delivery app, but the delivery is delayed due to some issues with the delivery agent. The user wants an estimated delivery time but does not want to share the contact number with the delivery agent. The user is looking for secure and trusted communication.

**Solution** - CleverTap Direct Call feature provides the user with a secured, contextual, and trusted form of voice communication to contact the delivery agent without sharing the phone number, thus ensuring complete privacy and security.\
This call masking feature helps an app to build trust with its users.

# Use Case

**Challenge** - A user has ordered groceries on a delivery app. The user will be unavailable on the scheduled delivery date and wants to reschedule the delivery quickly. The app does not have any options to communicate this date change. 

**Solution** - With CleverTap Direct Call, a user can communicate in-app by placing a request for a call back with a personalized context. So, the user does not have to set the context with the representative when the actual call begins, paving the way for a speedy issue resolution and a delightful user experience.\
The order ID and account name or ID are automatically captured when the in-app call request is placed, ensuring a highly personalized and contextual interaction.

# Use Case

**Challenge** - A grocery order of a user is out for delivery. The delivery agent is unable to locate the exact delivery address, which is required for timely delivery. The delivery agent tries to reach the user on a phone number, but the user ignores the call, assuming it is a spam number.

**Solution** - CleverTap Direct Call with in-app voice calling feature displays the context of the call over call screens to the user. It sets the context of the call, thus maximizing the call success ratio. CleverTap Direct Call also helps to establish the caller's authenticity (delivery agent in this case) between the app and the user.
