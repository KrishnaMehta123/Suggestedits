The _Start here_ section displays the setup information. 

This section has the following parts:

- **Start here**:  Displays the information for platforms such as FCM, Xiaomi, or iOS. Check that the required platforms are integrated and ready for campaigns. 
- **Qualification criteria**: Deliver the notification by Past Behavior, Custom List, or Live behavior. For more information about segmenting users, refer to [Segments](https://docs.clevertap.com/docs/segments).
- **Set a Goal**: You can track your campaign conversion by setting up a goal. This is optional. You can define your conversion goal further by selecting the Event and Conversion time. Setting a goal allows you to measure your campaign effectively against what you want to achieve in the campaign. 

The campaign goal can be as generic or as specific as you want. It can answer questions from _How many users were influenced to purchase an X amount?_ to _How many first-time visitors purchased red shoes worth a minimum of X amount and blue jackets worth a minimum of Y amount?_ ".
