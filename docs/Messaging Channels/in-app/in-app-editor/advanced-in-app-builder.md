The Advanced In-App Builder has a _What You See Is What You Get (WYSIWYG)_ interface, which allows you to make modifications in real-time.

It is divided into two main sections:

- **Canvas (Left Side)**: The canvas is where you design your In-App message. It is fully interactive, allowing you to drag and drop elements and adjust their position and size with ease.
- **Controls & Styling Menu (Right Side)**: This menu contains controls and styling options for the elements on the canvas. Any changes made here instantly reflect on the canvas in real time.

> 📘 Test and Preview
> 
> The _Preview and Test_ feature is currently unavailable for the Builder. To test your In-App message on a real device:
> 
> 1. **Send the Campaign**: Exclusively send the campaign to a specific user for testing.
> 2. **Recreate and Send**: After you are done testing, recreate the campaign and send it to your intended audience.

## Builder Elements

In the Advanced In-App Builder, _Elements_ are the core components used to construct your message. Upon opening the builder, three default elements are available, as shown in the following image:

      "sizing": "40% ",
      "border": true,
      "caption": "Default Elements"
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


### Overlay

The overlay provides a background for your In-App message, ensuring a seamless, integrated look.

        "https://files.readme.io/59d4503d9c0cbbc300f4e5d245189b55d4b065e499d310f33724c110f8d82b84-Overlay_slider.gif",
        null,
        "Design Overlay"
      ],
      "align": "center",
      "border": true,
      "caption": "Design Overlay"
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


The overlay allows you to modify the following:

- **Transparency level**: Control the transparency level of the Overlay.
- **Color Background**: Add a color background.
- **Image Background**: Add an image as a background. Click **Upload** to add an image.

### Container

The container holds all the content, such as text, images, and buttons, representing your In-App message.

[block:image]

  "images": [
    {
      "image": [
        "https://files.readme.io/5533cc57850f22fb837390faed0082612df60c482e4be8d08cad2a526a0bcb6d-image.png",
        null,
        "Design Container"
      ],
      "align": "center",
      "border": true,
      "caption": "Design Container"
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


The container allows you to modify the following:

- **Background**: Apply a background color or image to your design.
- **Aspect Ratio**: Select the Aspect ratio that best fits your use case.
- **Margin**: Adjust the margin percentage to create a buffer between your popup and the device edges.
- **Border Radius**: Control the roundness of the container's edges. A higher value results in a rounder appearance.

### Dismiss Button

The _Dismiss Button_ allows users to close the In-App message.

      ],
      "align": "center",
      "border": true,
      "caption": "Hide/Display Dismiss Button"
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


## Add New Elements Inside Container

Click **Add** on the canvas to add _Text_, _Image_, or _Button_.

[block:image]

  "images": [
    {
      "image": [
        "https://files.readme.io/c1950ae9cf14eb15e517649ad93edc2319c50b83ef422e708c1b27c40e54e851-screenrecording-2.gif",
        null,
        "Add Elements in Container"
      ],
      "align": "center",
      "border": true,
      "caption": "Add Elements in Container"
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


You can enhance your In-App message by adding the following elements inside the container:

- **Text**: Add text to convey your message. Use the available styling options to ensure it fits your brand's style.
- **Image**: Incorporate visuals or branding images to create an engaging experience.
  - The builder supports multiple image elements, which you can stack on top of each other.
  - Image elements can also function as buttons, enabling call-to-actions directly from the image.
- **Button**: Create call-to-action buttons, such as _Shop Now_ or_ Learn More_, with precise control over the design and positioning.

### Display Element Over or Behind an Element

When working with stacked elements such as images, text boxes, or buttons, the _Bring Forward_ and _Send Backward_ buttons manage their visibility on the user's screen. If one element overlaps another, clicking ** Bring Forward ** brings the selected element to the front, ensuring it is fully visible.

      ],
      "align": "center",
      "border": true,
      "caption": "Position Elements"
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


## Add Animations

The builder provides built-in animation options to improve the flow of the user experience. Animations are configured from the Container element.

      ],
      "align": "center",
      "border": true,
      "caption": " Design Animation"
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


You can enhance user interaction with the help of various animation options as follows:

- **Animation types**: Choose from Instant (default), Dissolve, or Move In animations.  
  The Duration is set in milliseconds, allowing you to experiment with different values and observe the effect in the canvas.
- The **Duration** value can be set in milliseconds, and you can try different settings and see how they behave in the Canvas
- The **Repeat** button replays the animation in the Canvas.
