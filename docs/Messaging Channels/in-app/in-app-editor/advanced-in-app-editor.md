## Key Capabilities

The **Advanced In-App Builder** offers remarkable flexibility and ease of use. Here are its key features:

- **Automatic Scaling**: All content automatically adjusts to fit different device sizes, ensuring consistent presentation across platforms.

- **Custom Positioning**: You can position elements freely inside containers, allowing any layout you envision.

- **Stacking Elements**: Stack images or other elements on top of each other for more complex designs.

- **Styling Options**: The interface exposes numerous styling options for every element, providing detailed control over the appearance.

## Builder Overview

The Advanced In-App Builder interface is divided into two main sections:

- **Canvas (Left Side)**: The canvas is where you design your in-app message. It is fully interactive, allowing you to drag and drop elements into place, and directly modify their position and size.

- **Controls & Styling Menu (Right Side)**: This menu contains controls and styling options for the elements on the canvas. Any changes made here are immediately reflected on the canvas in real-time.

## Elements: The Building Blocks

In the Advanced In-App Builder, **Elements** are the core components used to construct your message. Upon opening the builder, three default elements are available:

### Default Elements

1. **Overlay**: Provides a background for your in-app message, ensuring a seamless, integrated look.
   - Placeholder: Add more information about the overlay settings.
2. **Container**: Holds all the content such as text, images, and buttons.
   - Placeholder: Add more details about container customization and layout possibilities.
3. **Dismiss Button**: Allows users to close the in-app message.
   - Placeholder: Add additional details on styling and controlling dismiss actions.

### Adding New Elements Inside the Container

You can enhance your in-app message by adding the following elements inside the container:

- **Image**: Incorporate visuals or branding images to create an engaging experience.
- **Text**: Add text to convey your message. Use the available styling options to ensure it fits your brand’s style.
- **Button**: Create call-to-action buttons, such as "Shop Now" or "Learn More," with full control over design and positioning.

## Animations

The builder provides built-in animation options to improve the flow of the user experience:

- **Slide Animation**: Slide elements in from different directions.
- **Fade-In Animation**: Smoothly transition elements onto the screen with a fade effect.
