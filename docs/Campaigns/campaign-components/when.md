When\
After a campaign channel is selected, the When section will let you define a message type and Campaign start date and time.

With the above selection the campaign will run once and will start immediately after the required criteria are selected and the campaign is scheduled.

The other selection will let you run the same campaign on multiple dates or to keep running the campaign with a predefined frequency.
