You can view comprehensive reports for all campaigns you send out of CleverTap. You can use these reports to analyze campaign performance, compare performance across campaigns, and understand engagement trends.

Campaign reports allow monitoring campaign performance at a glance. You can mail either a summary report of all campaigns sent out in a particular date range or day-wise. This report includes metrics, such as campaign deliveries, engagements, conversions, and errors. To optimize dashboard performance, the data in the report is cached and you could receive data that has been generated up to 4 hours earlier. The report may take up to 6 hours depending on the other activities happening at the time of requesting the report.
