CleverTap offers geofencing which is a GPS location-based service that customers can use to engage their audience by sending relevant messages to Android and iOS users. A geofence is a virtual geographic area, represented as latitude and longitude pairs combined with a radius, forming a circle in a specific position on a map. Geofences can vary in size and a geofence cluster can contain up to 100 geofences. 

Users can define geofences on the CleverTap dashboard and trigger campaigns in real-time as users enter and exit them around the world. Campaigns are delivered in real-time to users as they exit or enter geofences or sent as follow-ups hours or days later. As the users enter or exit geofences, CleverTap's location analytics create user data that can be used for re-targeting and geofence-specific analytics can generate insight on activities or locations of interest.

# Create Geofences

To create geofences, perform the following steps:

1. From the CleverTap dashboard, select *Settings* > *Geofences*.
2.  Click **+ Geofence Cluster** to create a new geofence cluster.

## Optional Do Not Disturb Feature
When entering the details for the geofence cluster, you can select a Do Not Disturb (DND) window and if you select start and end time, you can also set a dwell time. The DND option prevents triggering an engagement for users who enter the geofence on specified days and times. Dwell time specifies the amount of time a user can remain inside the geofence before triggering an engagement.

# Use Geofence Events
CleverTap raises two system events every time a device enters or exits a geofence that can be used to run campaigns, analytics, and segmentation:
  * Geocluster Entered
  * Geocluster Exited

For more information, refer to [System Events](https://docs.clevertap.com/docs/events#section-system-events).
