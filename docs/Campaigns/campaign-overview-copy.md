# Overview

Campaigns promote products through various media types and are designed with specific goals, such as building brand awareness, introducing new products, or driving conversions.

The campaign listing page in CleverTap helps you manage all your campaigns efficiently. It allows you to filter them, edit columns, view performance, organize using labels, and more. This guide walks you through all key operations on the new campaigns page.

# Campaigns Operations

You can perform different actions on the campaigns from the _All Campaigns_ page, including filtering, labeling, editing, archiving, stopping, cloning, and analyzing performance. The following sections briefly discuss each operation.

## Filter Campaigns

You can use filters to quickly search your campaigns by Status, Channel, Time Period, creator, and more. To do so:

1. Go to _Messages_ > _Campaigns_ from the CleverTap dashboard. The _All Campaigns_ page opens.
2. Click the ![](https://files.readme.io/ac0ed6a-Filter_icon.png) icon. The _Filters_ window opens on the left side of the screen.

3. Select the required filters and click **Apply** to view results on the _All Campaigns_ page.
4. Click **Reset** to reset all the applied filters.

Filters are divided into two main sections, Active and Archived. Refer to the table below for filter operations:

| Filter Section             | Filter Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Options                                                                                      |

> 📘 Time Period Filters
>
> * By default, the date range for **Created** campaigns is _All time_.
> * By default, the date range for **Stats** campaigns is the _last 30 days_. The _All time range_ is unavailable for Stats.
> * Resetting reverts the Time Period filters to default values.
> * Date ranges saved in filters are relative to the current date. For example, a _past 2 days_ filter saved on July 2nd will show July 1st–2nd as the date range. When applied on July 20th, it shows July 19th–20th as the date range.

Filters are only applied after you click **Apply**. If you create a filter and do not select **Apply**, the filter criteria are still displayed but not applied directly in the listing view.

All filters except the _Delivery Type_ and _Segment Type_ filters also have individual reset options. You can reset a specific filter and click **Apply** to immediately see the updated results in the campaign list.

## Edit Columns

You can customize the campaign listing view to match your preferences. Click the _Edit Columns_ icon to select and reorder the columns you want displayed on the campaign list. You can view up to 2000 campaigns on the listing page.

The Sent column is toggled off by default. An Engagement Rate column is available to show channel-specific stats.

<Image align="center" alt="Edit Columns" border={true} caption="Edit Columns" src="https://files.readme.io/be3e0d05ae3e25119258ccd03b2cbf862937e840c4991064f92c2dbf0f0b1599-2025-12-11_18-40-00_1.gif" />

> 📘 Note
>
> * In the All Campaigns view, each campaign shows the associated Team.
> * Users can view and manage only the campaigns tied to their respective teams. This ensures visibility and access are aligned with your RBAC configuration.

## Campaign Reports

Selecting _Campaigns_ from the CleverTap Dashboard opens the Campaign Reports table where you can see all your campaigns across every channel in one consolidated view. Campaign Reports include the channel, delivery status, and key statistics to assess and compare performance.

Click Subscribe to reports and enter the details.

<Image align="center" alt={1422} border={true} caption="Filter Campaigns and View Campaign Reports" title="Filter Campaigns and view Campaign reports on CleverTap dashboard." src="https://files.readme.io/4179196a7509ec3d78977a0a4dee6e936edd8ae82e008a16a471d33cfbac1d64-2025-12-11_18-42-58.png" />

You can also email a report by selecting the campaign and clicking the email report icon.

<Image align="center" alt="Email Report" border={true} caption="Email Report" src="https://files.readme.io/815637006b08ebe05fae735f88e536af058eac46685c9c7e3e7b3fd57187d474-2025-12-11_18-46-35.png" />

If the report section opens with _All Time_ as the selected time period, requesting the report will automatically adjust the date range to ±15 days. A warning message will be displayed to inform the user of this change. For more details, refer to [Campaign Reports](https://staging.docs.user.clevertap.net/docs/campaign-reports-copy).

## Add Labels

Labels allow you to tag campaigns with descriptive names or themes. Once applied, labels allow you to group your various messaging campaigns so that you can view their performance or identify user behaviors. For example, you can create a label called _Onboarding_ to identify all the messaging campaigns (across all channels) related to onboarding your new users.

You can select up to 10 labels for a campaign. If a campaign already has more than 10 labels assigned from earlier configurations, they will still be visible under _Selected Labels_. However, in such cases, the user will not be able to select any additional labels.

> 📘 Naming Labels
>
> The labels cannot start with or contain the following symbols: ”, , %, >, \<, and !.

You can create and apply labels from the _All Campaigns_ or the _All Journeys_ page. Labels can be applied to individual campaigns from the All Campaigns page during creation. To do so:

1. Go to _Messages_ > _Campaigns_ from the CleverTap dashboard. The _All Campaigns_ page opens.
2. Select the campaigns you may want to label and click the _Add Label_ icon.
3. Select the labels you want to add. These labels are moved to the _Selected Tag ID_ section. Click **Deselect** to remove any label.
4. Click **Apply**.

<Image align="center" alt="Create Multiple Message Labels" border={true} caption="Create and Assign Multiple Message Labels" src="https://files.readme.io/3dd944e95bec99bc93eba8c1d3a729042e52cc3085530098ae42ee79e531f8fa-2025-12-11_18-49-11_1.gif" />

> 📘 Note
>
> * When applying labels in bulk, the selected labels are applied to _all_ selected campaigns. However, if you later select an individual campaign from that group, the bulk-applied labels do not automatically appear in the _Selected Tag ID_ section.
> * To view or manage the labels for a specific campaign, click the **Labels** icon next to the campaign.
>

You can view and export all labels to a CSV file from the _Settings_ >  _Setup_  > _Labels_  page. You can also edit or delete labels from this page.

<Image align="center" alt="View Labels" border={true} caption="View Labels" src="https://files.readme.io/e96d91674fd5178c48dcf69813fcd9110249717e1d5ffe42e5ed79ab4c8a7dcc-image.png" width="100% " />

## Archive Campaigns

Archiving campaigns helps to keep your CleverTap account organized and clutter-free, making it easy to find and view the campaigns you want. To do so:

1. Go to _Messages_ > _Campaigns_ from the CleverTap dashboard. The _All Campaigns_ page opens.
2. Select the campaigns you may want to archive and click the Archive icon.
3. Click **Save** to archive the selected campaigns or click **Cancel** to undo the action.

Running campaigns cannot be archived.

<Image align="center" alt="Archive Selected Campaigns" border={true} caption="Archive Selected Campaigns" src="https://files.readme.io/99629a5f98ff342e202d24b02c1cadc12487899a05aba35b50bef7086acb34d9-2025-12-11_18-46-35.png" />

> 📘 Note
>
> * Campaigns in Completed or Stopped state are automatically archived after 6 months. To view archived campaigns, click _Filters_ and select the _Archived_ filter.
> * Archived campaigns cannot be unarchived.
> * All archived campaigns (including drafts) are read‑only and cannot be published. To continue working on an archived campaign, clone it. The clone is treated as a new campaign. You can **Save as draft**, **schedule**, or **publish** the cloned (new) campaign.

## Stop Campaigns

You may want to stop a particular campaign after monitoring and evaluating its efficacy. To do so:

1. Go to _Messages_ > _Campaigns_ from the CleverTap dashboard. The _All Campaigns_ page opens.

1. Go to _Messages_ > _Campaigns_ from the CleverTap dashboard. The _All Campaigns_ page opens.
2. Click the ![](https://files.readme.io/0477193c16626ee55e9ef861d13f6cabfcec39dd80e79424384f83c6a9884089-Menu.png)  icon for the campaign you want to clone and click **Clone**.

  # Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) enforcement for campaign actions

  The campaign listing page supports Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to ensure users can only perform actions that align with their assigned roles and team permissions. A user should first have access to the Campaigns or Journeys in general. From there, their channel-level permissions determine their role within each channel:

  * Read access: If users have read access to Push Campaigns, they can view content for all Push Campaigns.
  * Write access: If users have write access to certain Campaigns, they can create, edit, clone, publish, or delete content, but only for channels where they have been explicitly granted channel-level write access.

  For more information, refer to [Channel Level Access](https://docs.clevertap.com/docs/role-based-access-control#channel-level-access).

  ### Access Behavior

  Refer to the following table for access behaviour. This applies to all actions across both Active and Archived campaigns.

  | **Access Type**  | **What the user can do**                                                           |
  | ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
  | **Write Access** | Full control over campaigns: Create, Edit, Clone, Archive, Stop, Start, Add Labels |
  | **Read Access**  | View campaign details, apply filters, and email campaign reports                   |

  ### Error Handling

  If a user attempts an action they don’t have permission for (for example, editing a campaign without write access), an error message is shown indicating insufficient permissions.

  <Image align="center" border={true} caption="Limited Access" src="https://files.readme.io/1f2e8a9d5b7534801b2b98cae50d54fa9074989f927dfbb6a33aa0ba36796dd8-image.png" width="50% " />

# Campaign States

Campaign Status helps track progress and manage campaigns efficiently. Each campaign state has distinct characteristics that determine what actions can be performed. 

### Campaign Lifecycle States

The following are the campaign states:

| State                 | Description                                                                             |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Draft**             | Campaign is created but not yet published.                                              |
| **Scheduled**         | Campaign is set to go live at a future time.                                            |
| **Running**           | Campaign is currently live and executing.                                               |
| **Awaiting Next Run** | Recurring campaign has completed a run and is waiting for the next scheduled execution. |
| **Completed**         | Campaign has finished running and is no longer active.                                  |
| **Stopped**           | Campaign has been permanently halted.                                                   |

### Approval-related States

These states apply only when the Creator–Approver workflow is enabled.
