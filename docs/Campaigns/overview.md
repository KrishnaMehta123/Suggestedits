## What are Campaigns?
A campaign in general is a series of steps intended to achieve a particular goal. At CleverTap, this means, targeting users via multiple communication channels through user segmentation and other features that help you achieve your campaign goal.

##How campaigns can influence decision making for the end consumer
CleverTap has multiple features within Campaigns that can be used to increase user engagement and also lead to faster decision making from a user perspective. 

Examples: 
- The recommendation feature, you can recommend products to a user based on the purchase history of the user by taking into consideration the products bought by other users who’ve had a similar purchase history.
- Best time campaigns compute the best time for a user based on the frequency of a pre-set event that you can define. This leads to increased user engagement.

##Components
Below are the components of the campaign creation flow that will help you define the segments, time of campaign execution among others that are required for a campaign to run.
