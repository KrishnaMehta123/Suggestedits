# Overview

*Best Time* is a feature that recommends the most optimal time to send a message to each user for a *Batch* campaign or a *Journey*. 

We optimize the message send-time for each user based on when that user is most active with your application. If you send a campaign with the *Best Time* feature enabled, users will be more likely to engage with your message when receiving it.

You can use the Best Time feature with the following channels: [Email](doc:email), [Push Notification](doc:push), [Web Push](doc:web-push), and [SMS](doc:sms).

You can use the Best Time feature with the following campaign types:

* One Time >  Later > Best Time
* Multiple Dates > Best Time on Every Date
* Multiple Dates > Combination of Best Time and Fixed Time
* Recurring > Best Time

# How It Works

We identify the *best time* based on a specific event that is chosen by you.

CleverTap sends *Best Time* campaigns by splitting a day into two-hour buckets, that is, 12 buckets in all. Your users are then assigned to one of these buckets based on the time of the day they are most active with your app. The user is then sent the Campaign or Journey in that two-hour window.

If there is any user who has not performed the selected event in the last 180 days, then they are sent the *Campaign/Journey* at the CleverTap default time. The default time is right after the 12th bucket.

For example, if a *Best Time* campaign is created on January 1 at 5:15 pm, then all users who are most active between 5:00 pm to 7:00 pm will qualify for the first bucket and receive the campaign immediately. The next run will happen at 7:15 pm, and users who are most active in the 7:00 pm to 9:00 pm bucket will receive the message. 

# Best Time Setup

Under *Settings* > *Setup* -> *Best Time* you can set up the event which will be used to calculate the best time.

# Notes

If *Best Time* is chosen as the delivery option, the following advanced options will be applicable:

* **User Time Zone:** Considering the *Best Time* feature chooses the time when the user is most active, the [user time zone](https://docs.clevertap.com/docs/notification-delivery-options#section-delivery-in-user-s-timezone) is always implicitly applied.
* **Global Throttle Limits:** [Message throttling](https://docs.clevertap.com/docs/messaging-frequency-caps#throttle) cannot be applied with the Best Time feature.
