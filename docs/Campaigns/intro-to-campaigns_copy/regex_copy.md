# Overview

Regex is a feature that provides the capability to create a campaign that includes or excludes users who visit specific pages on your website. 

> 📘 Regex Explained
>
> Regex is an abbreviation for the term regular expression which defines a search pattern for a string. The pattern can be a single character, multiple characters, or an expression with characters describing the pattern. 
>
> Following are some Regex examples: 
>
> * "." matches any character.
> * "ABC" matches ABC.
> * "A|B" matches A or B.

## Use Case

For example, if you have a travel booking site, you can create a campaign that targets users who are searching for flights between San Francisco and Los Angeles. When a user searches for flights from San Francisco (SFO) to Los Angeles (LAX) on your website, the URL follows this pattern: *[https://www.example.com/flights/SFO/LAX](https://www.example.com/flights/SFO/LAX)*. Using the Regex below, you can identify users who visited that URL and include them in a campaign.

```text Regex
.*(SFO|LAX).*
```

# Feature Guide

When creating a campaign in CleverTap that targets web users, you can use the Regex feature to define who receives the campaign based on pages the user did or did not visit. 

<Image title="regex2.png" alt={900} className="border" border={true} src="https://files.readme.io/8a70f69-regex2.png" />

If you want to include users who visited a page that matches the Regex, select the *matches regex* option. If you want to exclude those users, select the *does not match regex* option.

If there is only one page that needs to be matched or not matched for a campaign, then you can use the options *contains* or *does not contain*.
