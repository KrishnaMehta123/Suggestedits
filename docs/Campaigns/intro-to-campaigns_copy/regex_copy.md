# Overview

Regex is a feature that provides the capability to create a campaign that includes or excludes users who visit specific pages on your website. 
[block:callout]
{
  "type": "info",
  "body": "Regex is an abbreviation for the term regular expression which defines a search pattern for a string. The pattern can be a single character, multiple characters, or an expression with characters describing the pattern. \n\nFollowing are some Regex examples: \n* \".\" matches any character.\n* \"ABC\" matches ABC.\n* \"A|B\" matches A or B.",
  "title": "Regex Explained"

## Use Case
For example, if you have a travel booking site, you can create a campaign that targets users who are searching for flights between San Francisco and Los Angeles. When a user searches for flights from San Francisco (SFO) to Los Angeles (LAX) on your website, the URL follows this pattern: *https://www.example.com/flights/SFO/LAX*. Using the Regex below, you can identify users who visited that URL and include them in a campaign.
[block:code]
{
  "codes": [
    {
      "code": ".*(SFO|LAX).*",
      "language": "text",
      "name": "Regex"
    }
  ]
}
[/block]

# Feature Guide

When creating a campaign in CleverTap that targets web users, you can use the Regex feature to define who receives the campaign based on pages the user did or did not visit. 
[block:image]
{
  "images": [
    {
      "image": [
        "https://files.readme.io/8a70f69-regex2.png",
        "regex2.png",
        900,
        400,
        "#f5f8fb"
      ],
      "border": true
    }
  ]
}
[/block]
If you want to include users who visited a page that matches the Regex, select the *matches regex* option. If you want to exclude those users, select the *does not match regex* option.

If there is only one page that needs to be matched or not matched for a campaign, then you can use the options *contains* or *does not contain*.
