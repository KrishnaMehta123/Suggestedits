# Overview

Comprehensive reports are viewable for all campaigns you send out of CleverTap. You can use these reports to analyze campaign performance, compare performance across campaigns, and understand engagement trends.

Campaign reports provide the capability to monitor a campaign's performance at a glance. You can email a summary report of all campaigns sent out in a particular date range or split it by day. This report includes metrics, such as campaign deliveries, engagements, conversions, and errors. To optimize dashboard performance, the data in the report is cached and you can receive data that has been generated up to four hours earlier. Also, it is possible that the report is sent to you within six hours depending on the other activities happening at the time of requesting the report.

1. From the dashboard, navigate to _Campaigns_.
2. Select the campaigns for the report or select using the filter criteria.
