## Overview

CleverTap offers geofencing which is a GPS location-based service that customers can use to engage their audience by sending relevant messages to Android and iOS users. A geofence is a virtual geographic area, represented as latitude/longitude pairs combined with a radius, forming a circle in a specific position on a map. Geofences can vary in size and a geofence cluster can contain up to 100 geofences. 

Users can define geofences on the CleverTap dashboard and trigger campaigns in real-time as users enter and exit them around the world. Campaigns are delivered in real-time to users as they exit or enter geofences, or sent as followups hours or days later. As the users enter or exit geofences, CleverTap's location analytics create user data that can be used for re-targeting, and geofence-specific analytics can generate insight on activities or locations of interest.

# Create Geofences

To create geofences, perform the following steps:

1. From the CleverTap dashboard, select *Settings* > *Geofences*.

## Optional Features
When entering the details for the geofence cluster, you can select a DND window and if you select start and end time, you can also set a dwell time. The DND option prevents triggering an engagement for users who enter the geofence on specified days and times. Dwell time specifies the amount of time a user can remain inside the geofence before triggering an engagement.

# Use Geofence Events
CleverTap raises two system events every time a device enters or exits a geofence that can be used to run campaigns, analytics, and segmentation:
  * Geocluster Entered
  * Geocluster Exited

Details about the event are provided in the events documentation section [here](https://docs.clevertap.com/docs/events#section-system-events).

# Add Geofence Clusters in a Campaign
Once you have configured your geofence clusters, you can add them to a campaign by performing the following steps.

1. Select *In-action within time* as your mobile push type. 
2. Select the campaign start and end time.
3. Click ** + Create an ad-hoc segment**.
