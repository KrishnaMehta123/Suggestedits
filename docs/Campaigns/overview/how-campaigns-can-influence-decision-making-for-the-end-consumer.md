How campaigns can influence decision making for the end consumer\
CleverTap has multiple features within Campaigns that can be used to increase user engagement and also lead to faster decision making from a user perspective. 

Examples:\
The recommendation feature, you can recommend products to a user based on the purchase history of the user by taking into consideration the products bought by other users who’ve had a similar purchase history.\
Best time campaigns compute the best time for a user based on frequency of a pre-set event that you can define. This leads to increased user engagement.
