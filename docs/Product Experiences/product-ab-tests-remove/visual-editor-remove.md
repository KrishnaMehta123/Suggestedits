The Visual Editor is a mode of A/B testing your app by making the changes visually. 

Select the visual editor from the menu on the left navigation. Setting goals and selecting target segments is the same as in Dynamic Variables. However, variant creation is different. After you click 'Create Variant', you will be asked to connect a device.

  Selecting OS

Select your app's OS on the dashboard. Open your app on your mobile phone. You will be asked to make gestures with your phone to identify and connect your device with the CleverTap dashboard. Follow the instructions on the screen.

After you finish making the gesture, your device is displayed on the dialog box.

After the connection is established, CleverTap mirrors your app screen on your dashboard and you can directly change your app screen.

  Editing elements on your screen visually
</Image>

You can make the following changes to your screen:

1. The text
2. Font size
3. Text foreground color
4. Text background color
5. Opacity percentage
6. Show/hide the element
7. Image
8. Color of a section

You can create up to 8 variants including the control variant. No changes can be made to the control variant. A default control variant ensures that your experiment is measured against a variant without any biases.
