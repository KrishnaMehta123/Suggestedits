Product experiences provide the capability to show personalized experiences by changing the behavior and appearance of your app remotely without an update. Marketers and developers can experiment with individual users by testing their responses and rolling out the winning variant to a defined segment or your entire user base to increase customer retention. These experiments are optimized, hyper-targeted, and relevant to each unique user.

Product experiences also let you test what experiences work best or keep the user engaged before rolling it out to a wider set. You can design user flows right from the dashboard without multiple app releases which reduce development efforts.

#Features 
Marketers can test out various hypotheses on the UI flow and app flow by experimenting with a small set of users and understanding how it is being perceived by the user. 

You can experiment and test anything, including: 
  * Visual elements: images, videos, and color options
  * App content 
  * App layout 
  * Custom text: font size and background colors of any highlighted text 
  * Product flows: onboarding flow 
  * New features and releases: app release updates 
  * User flow: user navigation  
  * Premium offers and free trials 
  * Dynamic: strings, integers, doubles, floats, booleans, arrays, key-value pairs, and recommendations
  * Other elements: pricing, load speed, speed of app elements, and display ads

CleverTap provides product configs and feature flags as a capability to test these experiments and provide in-app personalization at a large scale. You can keep iterating on the basis of the users' responsiveness.
