# Overview

The Inbox messaging channel enables you to deliver rich, individualized notifications to your users. Using the Inbox channel, you can stack notifications sent to your users under a notification window across all platforms, that is, both mobile and web apps. 

The Inbox channel allows you to send lasting content directly to the user inbox from the CleverTap dashboard. Moreover, inbox messages are targeted to individual segments. It provides a unified experience to the user. For example, if the user views a message on any platform, the message is marked as read on all other platforms.

The advantage of this feature is that the marketers need not create multiple campaigns to target users on different platforms. These personalized experiences can be persistent at a user level and are available whenever the user relaunches or reinstalls the app.
