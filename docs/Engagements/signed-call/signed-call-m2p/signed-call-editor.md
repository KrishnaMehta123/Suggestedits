Marketers get instant access to ready-to-use Signed Call templates for creating single and interactive voice call campaigns. CleverTap supports two types of templates:

### Audio Template

The Audio template enables you to run a call campaign for your target audience. You must define the *Call Subject* and add the *Audio file URL* of the audio file you want to play (as shown below). This audio file is played when an end user answers the call.

This template can be used in various domains, such as Telecom, Banking, ISPs, and so on, for sending reminders to customers regarding their due recharge or subscription renewals.

### Interactive Voice Response Template

The Interactive Voice Response (IVR) template enables you to execute interactive voice campaigns for your audience. You can use this template to capture automated inputs from your customers.

This template is best suited when businesses want to capture feedback or inputs directly over a call. For example, a bus service provider seeking journey feedback from passengers after their trip.

To initiate these campaigns, begin by defining a *Call Subject* and adding a Primary audio file URL. The Primary audio offers a quick context and prompts the customers for input. 

For example, a user receiving an IVR survey campaign from a banking company is nudged to rate their banking service.\
Upon answering the call, the Primary audio file asks the user to rate their banking experience on a scale of five (1- lowest, and 5 - the highest).

When customers answer an IVR call, the system plays the primary audio offering a selection menu. Based on your business needs, configure and map specific responses from the primary audio to each numeric key on the phone keypad. You can customize responses for each numeric keypad input (0 through 9) and the \* key

For each keypad number, choose whether to play an audio file and end the call or end the call directly. Refer to the image below for a better understanding:
