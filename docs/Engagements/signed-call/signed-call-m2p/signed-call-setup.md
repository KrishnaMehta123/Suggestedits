# Set Up Signed Call Branding

You can customize the brand logo, theme, and color for both Signed Call campaigns:

- _Machine to Person_
- _Person to Person_  

An incoming call with business branding increases call credibility and personalizes the user experience. 

This section explains how to set up _Content_, and _Style_ for the incoming and ongoing call screens. 

To set up Signed Call Branding for your _Machine to Person_ or _Person to Person Calling_ campaign:

1. Navigate to **Settings** > **Channels** >**Signed Call**.
