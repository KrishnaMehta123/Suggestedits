# Overview

Signed Call™ is a new-age voice communication system that uses Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) technology. The Signed Call SDKs enable you to send and receive voice calls over the Internet. You only need a device with an active internet connection and Signed Call SDK integration to make voice calls.

Key advantages of the Signed Call channel include:

* Initiating voice calls without the need to share phone numbers
* Enhanced cost-effectiveness and security compared to traditional Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) calls.
* Developers get comprehensive control over call flows, interfaces, and related functionalities.

Businesses can also leverage the [Signed Call Live API](doc:signed-call-copy#signed-call-live) to track the presence of external users on their web or mobile app. Using this data, internal team members (such as Sales executives) can contact the users immediately through a Signed Call. This approach helps you nurture your leads better.
