- **Calls**: Represents the number of calls made across the target users
- **Received**: Represents the number of calls landed on the end user device
- **Answered**: Represents the total number of calls answered by the end users
- **IVR Interactions**: Represents the overall audio interactions by the end users

For the _Users drop off time_ and _Response Received_ events, you also get a bar chart view (as shown above) that helps you analyze the call data
