# App Inbox as a Channel

Push notification and in-app campaigns are great for grabbing the app user's attention, but they are short-lived. Once swiped off, they lose their ability to engage the customer. If the user is not online or is busy, you lose the opportunity to engage with them forever.

*App Inbox* provides the ability to send lasting content directly to your app from the CleverTap dashboard. Moreover, the inbox messages are targetable to individual segments such as other messaging channels. Your inbox can look different from the inbox of another user; the possibilities are endless.

# Examples

## Simple Message

This type of Inbox message consists of only the Title and a Message in the App Inbox. It is an app inbox without the image.\
You can select this template from the WHAT section of the campaign.

## Carousel Message with Content

Carousel messages in push notifications show multiple images under one notification. It can be personalized according to the campaign run. For every carousel image, we can put a new personalized message, according to the content. You can also add a link for each carousel message to navigate the users to that particular page.

## Carousel Message Without Content

Carousel messages without content can be made in an attractive way that can grab the user's attention and also convey your motive for the campaign. You can add your promotional campaign creatives about your products as an image here without any text message. 

## Message with Icon

When you run a message with an icon app inbox campaign, unlike the “carousel with content” feature, here you cannot add multiple images. You can just add one single image in the given format along with any personalized or generic title and text that you would like to send to the users.
