# Overview

The Click Heat Map is a powerful visual representation of your email that highlights the links that have been clicked. This feature allows users to see which links are performing well and helps determine optimal link placement within email campaigns. By analyzing these metrics, users can make informed decisions about potential changes to content blocks based on link performance.

The Click Heat Map displays the email you’ve sent to your users, overlaid with color-coded representations of link clicks. Each link features numbers indicating the total number of clicks, enabling you to see how the placement of each link impacts your campaign metrics.

### Color Coding

Color coding provides a quick and intuitive way to assess click activity across your email links. Here's what each color represents:

* **Red**: Represents the highest clicked links.
* **Orange**: Indicates the next tier of highly clicked links.
* **Yellow**: Shows moderate click activity.
* **Green**: Reflects lower click activity.
* **Blue**: Represents minimal clicks.
* **Gray**: All links with no clicks will be represented in Gray.

5. **Select Metrics**: From the drop-down menu, choose "Total Clicks," "Unique Clicks," or "Click Rate" to view the corresponding click data for each link.

   * **Total Clicks**: Counts every click on all links, regardless of the recipient.
   * **Unique Clicks**: Counts distinct recipients who have clicked a link, regardless of the number of clicks.
   * **Click Rate**: Calculated by dividing unique clicks by the total number of delivered emails, multiplied by 100. This metric helps assess the effectiveness of your email’s call-to-action.

6. **Choose Email Variant**: From the drop-down menu, select the email variant from the campaign you want to analyze.

7. **AMP Email Campaigns**: For AMP email campaigns, select AMP from the drop-down (default is set to HTML).

8. **View Link Performance**: The right pane will display each link, sorted by color from highest to lowest clicks. You’ll see stats for "Total Clicks," "Unique Clicks," and "Click Rate" for each link.

9. **View User Details**: Click on *View User Details* to access the *Events* page under *Analytics*.

With the Click Heat Map, you can effectively analyze link performance and make data-driven adjustments to enhance the effectiveness of your email campaigns.
