# Use Case

Once the call is initiated, there is no need for the user to explain the context of the call, thus ensuring speedy issue resolution. Also, phone numbers are not shared, which protects user privacy and security.

**Challenge** - A caller asks a user to upload confidential documents to complete the loan application process or verification. The user is unsure whether the caller is authentic or a fraud trying to acquire and misuse this information.

**Solution** - CleverTap Direct Call powers in-app calls meaning only authorized personnel can initiate calls to a user. This, in turn, means that whenever users look at their incoming call screen and find the brand's logo powered by Direct Call, they know it is authentic. It also improves the call success ratio by building trustworthiness for the brand. These calls can also be recorded for training and audit purposes.

# Use Case
**Challenge** - A user is browsing through various insurance policies on the app and is planning to buy one.
