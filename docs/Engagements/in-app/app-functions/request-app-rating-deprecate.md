Rating primer campaigns aim to guide users to leave a review during moments of satisfaction. For example, asking for ratings after high-satisfaction moments, such as feature success or subscription renewal.

> 📘 Tip
> 
> Precede with a message explaining the value of the rating to improve chances of success. This message is ideal after a purchase, milestone, or subscription renewal.

# Considerations

- OS controls when and how often the prompt appears (may not show every time).
- Cannot be forced or tracked.
- No outcome data (rating result) is available.
