As an added security measure, in CleverTap you can set up two-factor authentication while logging in. 

# Set Up Two Factor Authentication 

To set up two-factor authentication (2FA), you need to navigate to the *My Profile* tab, under settings. Once there, you can enable two-factor authentication. Once enabled, subsequent logins into the CleverTap dashboard will require you to enter your second authentication factor.

In such a case, admins of the respective organizations can reset the 2FA key for that particular account.
