As an added security measure, in CleverTap you can set up two-factor authentication while logging in. 

# Set Up Two Factor Authentication

To set up two-factor authentication, you need to navigate to the *My Profile* tab, under settings. Once there, you can enable two-factor authentication. Once enabled, subsequent logins into the CleverTap dashboard will require you to enter your second authentication factor.

> 🚧 Currently CleverTap supports 2FA via Google Authenticator.

* Navigate to the *My Profile* tab under the settings section in your CleverTap Dashboard
* Enable 2FA
* Download the Google Authenticator App
* Scan the barcode you see on the CleverTap Dashboard

Once you have enabled 2FA, you need to enter the one-time-password generated by the Google Authenticator application each time you try to log into your CleverTap account.
