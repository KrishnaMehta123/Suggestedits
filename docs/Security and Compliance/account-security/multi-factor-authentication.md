Multi Factor Authentication is a security system that requires more than one method of authentication from independent categories of credentials to verify the user's identity for a login.

# Enable Multi Factor Authentication #
Go to Settings-> Account and you will see a toggle for "Two Factor Authentication".
On turning this toggle ON, all users for your account will have to go through Two-Factor Authentication which is enter a password and a security code to login to the CleverTap Account.
Only Admins have access to turning on/off Two - Factor Authentication for their accounts.

## Users who login for the first tome with MFA ##
Users will enter their password and will be taken to the next page where they will need to scan the barcode using a [Google Authenticator App](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2&hl=en_IN).
This will provide users with a security code which they can enter and on successful authentication will be able to access the dashboard.

## Users already on MFA ##
Users who had already turned on MFA for their individual account will notice no change in the login and will be able to access the dashboard using the same workflow.
They will enter their user email, password and in the next step add security code to login.
