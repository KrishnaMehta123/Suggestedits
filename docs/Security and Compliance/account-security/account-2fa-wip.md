As an added security measure, in CleverTap you can set up two-factor authentication while logging in. 

# Set Up Two Factor Authentication 

To set up two-factor authentication (2FA), you need to navigate to the *My Profile* tab, under settings. Once there, you can enable two-factor authentication. Once enabled, subsequent logins into the CleverTap dashboard will require you to enter your second authentication factor.

  1. Navigate to the *Settings* > Profile section (available at the top right corner) in your CleverTap dashboard. 
  2. Enable 2FA
  3. Download the Google Authenticator App
  4. Scan the barcode you see on the CleverTap Dashboard

Once you have enabled 2FA, you need to enter the one-time password generated by the Google Authenticator application each time you try to log into your CleverTap account.

# Reset 2FA

Accounts that have 2FA enabled for the dashboard access might require to reset their 2FA keys in case they lose access to their authenticator app.

In such a case, admins of the respective organizations can reset the 2FA key for that particular account.

}
[/block]
To reset a 2FA key for a particular account:

1. Navigate to *Settings* > *Security* > *2 Factor Authentication*. This will display the list of all your organization’s accounts that have 2FA enabled.
