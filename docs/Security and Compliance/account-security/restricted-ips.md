# Overview

CleverTap's *Settings* page is now updated with a new *Security* section that includes *IP Whitelisting* and *Multi Factor Authentication* (2FA). These features make the process of authentication more intuitive and self-serve for the customers.

The CleverTap dashboard showcases business-sensitive information such as revenue, app installs, conversions, and so on. So organizations might need to restrict the dashboard access to certain administrative users after integrating CleverTap SDK for different business reasons.

It's important to bear in mind that only admins have the right to Add/Delete IPs to manage access to the dashboard.

## How to Whitelist IP Addresses

To whitelist an IP, the admin needs to follow the steps below:

1. Navigate to *Settings* > *Security* > *IP Whitelisting*

3. Enter the specific IP address and click **Whitelist IP address**.
