# Renewal Cycles

1. ISO Certification is renewed every 4 years subject to a surveillance audit passed every year. 
2. SOC 2 Type 2 certification is renewed every year.

## Safe to Host

CleverTap conducts external Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing (VAPT) on a quarterly basis to ensure our platform is free from any vulnerability/threat.\
The *Safe to Host* certificate provides an assurance that the VAPT was successfully conducted and that it is free of any potential vulnerabilities that were identified. 

# How CleverTap complies

## COPPA

COPPA imposes certain requirements on operators of websites or online services directed to children under 13 years of age, and on operators of other websites or online services that have actual knowledge that they are collecting personal information online from a child under 13 years of age.

CleverTap complies by way of: 

1. Ensuring that data sent about children below 13 years is done with the consent of the parent/guardian.
2. Providing the ‘opt-out’ handle on the SDK which can be used by the customers to not send data to CleverTap in case of no consent by the users.

## CCPA

The CCPA provides California residents with specific rights regarding their personal information and data portability.

CleverTap complies by way of:\
Ensuring compliance to the law of consumer data not leaving the USA by providing an AWS Data Centre locally.\

## PCI-DSS

This law is applicable to all entities that store and process Credit Card Data

CleverTap does not store any credit card data.\

## HIPAA

The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) is a federal law that required the creation of national standards to protect sensitive patient health information from being disclosed without the patient’s consent or knowledge.

CleverTap is HIPAA compliant as it falls under the scope of a Business Associate.

## ISO/IEC 27001:2013

ISO/IEC 27001 is an international standard on how to manage information security organization-wide.

CleverTap complies by way of being ISO/IEC 27001:2013 certified.
