CleverTap for Startups is a self serve program where we have customized our offering to suit the needs of early-stage startups by making it more flexible and affordable.

Under this program, we have created the [Essentials Plan](doc:plans-programscopy) which offers a monthly subscription, starts with as low as 5K Monthly Active Users for just $75 a month, and offers the flexibility of choosing the add-ons and scale ranging from 5K to 100K MAU.

With this offering, Startups can start using CleverTap from pre-launch and get access to CleverTap's Enterprise Grade product from Day 0. There is a one-click option to migrate to our Enterprise plan once the startups have scaled up without any hassle of switching to other solutions or doing manual migrations.

In the CleverTap for Startups Program, we also have a community called [CleverTap Leap](https://staging.docs.user.clevertap.net/docs/plans-programscopy?utm_source=C4S&utm_medium=doc&utm_id=KB#leap-program). Here, we collaborate with accelerators, incubators, venture capital firms, and businesses worldwide. Together, we offer special advantages and reduced rates on the CleverTap Essential Plan to their startup portfolio or network.

Our partner program benefits both current and alumni-affiliated startups. You can find more details and check your eligibility for the LEAP Program [here](https://clevertap.com/leap/?utm_source=C4S&utm_medium=doc&utm_campaign=KB).
