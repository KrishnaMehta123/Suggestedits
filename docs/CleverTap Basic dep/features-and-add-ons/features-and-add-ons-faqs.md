## What is the delivery rate for Push Notifications sent via CleverTap?

Reachability of 100% is possible only for iOS for the opted-in users. In the case of Android, it is usually impossible due to the battery optimization features of the Chinese OEMs such as One plus, Xiaomi, etc.  
With CleverTap, you can achieve a delivery rate of over 80%. For more details regarding increasing the push delivery rate, refer [here](https://clevertap.com/blog/push-deliverability/).
