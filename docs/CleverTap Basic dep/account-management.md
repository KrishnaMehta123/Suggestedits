For accounts in the trial period, the downgrade happens instantly. For active accounts, the MAU downgrade will be effective after the current billing period. You can cancel the downgrade request anytime before that. And, if you upgrade to a higher MAU tier before the current billing period ends, the scheduled downgrade will get cancelled.
