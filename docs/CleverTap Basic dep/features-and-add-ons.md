# Features

Consider the following features as part of the CleverTap for Startups basic plan:

## Behavioral Analytics

You can get to know your users deeply by tracking their actions and preferences using the following features: We give you powerful tools to analyze your data to gain insights such as: 

* [Boards](https://docs.clevertap.com/docs/simple-reports): In CleverTap, we have pre-built dashboards to help you answer general questions about your app usage.
* [Funnels](https://docs.clevertap.com/docs/funnels): Funnels are defined as a series of events a user performs in a particular order. Funnels show users progress through defined paths in your app and pinpoint where they drop off between steps.
* [Cohorts](https://docs.clevertap.com/docs/cohorts): Cohort analysis is a way to group users who are similarly based on who or what they have done and to track their behavior over time.
* [Trends](https://docs.clevertap.com/docs/trends): Trends provide you with the capability to understand how users are using the platform.
* [Pivots](https://docs.clevertap.com/docs/pivots): Pivots can derive significance and insights from your user data. The pivot analysis tool summarizes your data with the help of tables and other data visualizations.
* [Flows](https://docs.clevertap.com/docs/flows): Flows can understand how a user navigates through an app, giving a broad view of the common paths users take and where they get stuck.
* [Real impact](https://docs.clevertap.com/docs/real-impact): Real Impact is a reporting dashboard that shows how and by what extent users respond to your CleverTap marketing campaigns—everything from the revenue generated to churn.

> 📘 Integrate with Email and SMS Service Providers

## Campaigns

CleverTap [campaigns](https://docs.clevertap.com/docs/campaign-approval-workflow) communicate with your users at scale. Make use of the 13 different messaging channels. The campaign feature provides you with a ‘test campaign’ button to test it before you send it to the end users. 

## Journey Orchestration

A [Journey](https://docs.clevertap.com/docs/journeys) is a visual campaign builder that lets you create omnichannel messaging experiences for your users. Journeys are ideal for engaging users across your app., depending on their action or inaction, and users can be nudged further ahead through Journeys.

## Lifecycle optimization

As the name suggests, CleverTap [Lifecycle Optimizer](https://docs.clevertap.com/docs/lifecycle-optimizer) provides a guided and end-to-end solution for your retention flow.

## Segmentation

The [Segment](https://docs.clevertap.com/docs/segments) feature can group users based on their actions, actions not performed, or user profile properties that match defined criteria. [RFM Analysis](https://docs.clevertap.com/docs/rfm) feature helps you analyze the health of your user base and run engagement campaigns to target specific user segments that need improvement. RFM Analysis is a user segmentation model that segments your users based on how recently and frequently they performed a specific event.

## Individualization

Individualization can be achieved through [Catalogs](https://docs.clevertap.com/docs/catalog). If you run a multilingual application, you can personalize each message based on the user's preferred language through [Personalize Message](https://docs.clevertap.com/docs/personalize-message-all), capability to create personalized content for each user based on their unique historical data through [Recommendations](https://docs.clevertap.com/docs/recommendations).

# Add-ons

As a part of the C4S Basic plan, a few of the features available in the Enterprise plans are available as additional Add-ons. These Add-ons have to be added to your billing to be able to use them. 

While a few Add-ons are free, you must pay for the remaining ones. Add-ons are priced based on two buckets - Some are charged at 5% of the base plan, whereas others are charged at 10%. The Base plan is the one you initially selected that suits your MAU requirements.
