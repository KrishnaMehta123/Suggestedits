# Overview

Promo events are system events generated by CleverTap's promo module in response to reward actions such as issuing a coupon, crediting wallet points, or distributing a partner voucher. These events come enriched with event metadata that can be used to personalize communication campaigns using Liquid tags.

These events help power dynamic user engagement workflows. For example, a user rewarded with a coupon can be automatically added to a Live segment that receives a push notification with the coupon code dynamically inserted into the message.
