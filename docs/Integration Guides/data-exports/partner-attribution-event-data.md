# Overview

Go to *Settings > Partners > Attribution partners* .

We receive 3 types of data from our attribution partners:

  * Inorganic Install Events - All data received from ad networks such as Facebook and Google via vendors such as Adjust, Appsflyer, and branch. CleverTap will process and save this data.
  * Organic Install Events - All data received from Playstore or referrals. Because this data is recorded by CleverTap it is disabled by default for the attribution partners. You can choose to enable this data from the attribution patterns. However, it will lead to duplication of data. You can turn off CleverTap in this case and choose to receive data only from the attribution partners.
  * Custom Events: Any custom events defined in your app.
