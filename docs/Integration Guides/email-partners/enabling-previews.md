Before you can start using Inbox previews, you must enable them.\
In the dashboard, navigate to Settings and click Integration > Email > Setup previews.

The Setup previews page lists previews for the available email inboxes. For example, a mobile device that runs Gmail on Android 8 or a computer that runs Apple Mail 10 on an OSX 10.10 Operating system. 

> 🚧 Note
>
> You must specify the accounts that must have email previews and spam reports before signing up. Email previews are available only if you have opted for the email add-on from CleverTap.\
> This feature is not available for trial accounts.

# Search the email clients

You can search and select all the required email clients from the setup previews page.
