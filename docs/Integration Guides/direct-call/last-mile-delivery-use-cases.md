# Overview

This page explains the use cases of CleverTap Direct Call in Last-Mile Delivery Businesses.

# Use Case 1

**Challenge** - A user has placed an order on a food delivery app. The order delivery is delayed due to some issues on the part of the delivery agent. The user wants to get an estimated delivery time but does not want to share the contact number with the delivery agent and is looking for a secure and trusted communication means.

**Solution** - CleverTap's Direct Call feature provides the user with a secured, contextual, and trusted in-app channel of voice communication to contact the delivery agent without sharing the phone number, thus ensuring complete privacy and security.\
This call masking feature helps an app to build trust with its users.

# Use Case 2

**Challenge** - A user has ordered groceries on a delivery app. The user has some urgent work on the scheduled delivery date and wants to reschedule the delivery quickly. The user cannot refer to any such option of rescheduling the delivery in the app.

**Solution** - With CleverTap's Direct Call, a user can communicate in-app by placing a request for a call back with a personalized context. So, the user doesn't have to set the context with the representative when the actual call begins, paving the way for a speedy issue resolution and a delightful user experience.\
The order ID and account name/ID are automatically captured when the in-app call request is placed, ensuring a highly personalized and contextual interaction.

# Use Case 3

**Challenge** - A grocery order of a user is out for delivery. The delivery agent is unable to locate the exact delivery address. Unless the delivery agent knows the exact address, the agent won't be able to fulfill the timely delivery of the order. The delivery agent is trying to reach the user on a phone number, but the user ignores the call assuming it to be a spam number.

**Solution** - CleverTap Direct Call with in-app voice calling feature displays the context of the call over call-screens to the user. It predetermines the context of the call, thus maximizing the call success ratio. The CleverTap direct call also enables an authentication layer over the call screen between the app and the user that helps to ensure the authenticity of the caller (delivery agent in this case).
