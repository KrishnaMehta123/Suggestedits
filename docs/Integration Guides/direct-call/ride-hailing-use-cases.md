# Overview
This page explains the use cases of CleverTap Direct Call in Ride-Hailing Businesses.

# Use Case 1
**Challenge** - A user wants to raise a complaint or a query related to a past ride. The user decides to raise a callback request. After receiving the call, the user must set the context (I am XYZ, phone number 123, had booked a cab today morning, and so on.) before they can ask for help from the customer care executive.
Users often have to repeat their problems which consumes their valuable time. This increases the time customer care teams spend on listening to user problems and providing a resolution.

**Solution** - With CleverTap's Direct Call feature, a user can communicate by requesting a free in-app voice call to customer care and providing a fully personalized context before the real communication begins. This paves the way for a speedy resolution of the issue elevating the user experience.

# Use Case 2
**Challenge** - A user wants to communicate the location or the arrival time to the driver after booking a ride. The user does not want to share the contact number with the driver for privacy reasons and wants a secure and trusted means of communication.

**Solution** - CleverTap Direct Call provides the user with a secured, contextual, and trusted in-app channel of voice communication to contact the driver without sharing the phone number, thus ensuring full privacy and security. 
This call masking feature helps an app to build trust with its users. 

# Use Case 3
**Challenge** - A user has booked a cab, and the driver has arrived at the location. The driver tried reaching the user, but the user missed the call. The user ignored the call because it was from an unknown number.

**Solution** - With CleverTap Direct Call, when a user receives a call within the app, they know the context of the call. If they miss the call, an actionable push notification is sent to the user via the app. This notification helps the user to get a callback or chat with the concerned party. This improves user experience and reduces the waiting time for both the driver and the user. 

# Use Case 4
**Challenge** - A driver cannot find the pin location of the user who has booked a ride. The driver tried reaching the user, but the user's phone was engaged. Due to a lack of communication, both the driver and the user are waiting. 

**Solution** - CleverTap Direct Call's in-app voice capability displays the context of the call over call-screens to their users. Hence, the call context is predetermined, ensuring a maximum call success ratio. This saves precious time for both the driver and the rider and improves the user experience.
