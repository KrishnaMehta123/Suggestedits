# Overview
This page explains the use cases of CleverTap Direct Call in Fintech Businesses.

# Use Case 1
**Challenge** - A user wants to raise a query related to a bank account. The user is unsure whom to call and does not want to share his contact number while calling for security and privacy reasons. 

**Solution** - With CleverTap Direct Call, a user has an option to request an in-app callback. Once the call is initiated, there is no need for the user to explain the context of the call, thus ensuring speedy issue resolution. Also, there is no sharing of phone numbers; it protects user privacy and security.

# Use Case 2
**Challenge** - A user gets a call from the fintech company/app representative saying that the user needs to upload certain confidential documents to complete the loan application process or KYC. The user is unsure whether the caller is authentic or a fraud trying to acquire and misuse this information.

**Solution** - CleverTap's Direct Call feature enables an authentication layer over the call screen between the app and the end-user. This ensures the authenticity of the calling party. It also improves the call success ratio by building trustworthiness for the brand.
These calls can also be recorded for training and audit purposes.

# Use Case 3
**Challenge** - A user is browsing through various insurance policies on the app and is planning to buy one. The user is unsure about the policies' specific terms and conditions and which one will be best suited for his needs. An instant query resolution can help users accelerate their decision-making process.

**Solution** - With CleverTap Direct Call, the product champions can intervene and connect with their user via a call without interrupting the in-app experience. A user can always request a callback via the app. You do not need a phone number or any user's details to initiate a call, ensuring privacy at all times.
