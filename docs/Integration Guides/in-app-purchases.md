In-app purchases (IAP) are additional features or functionality that users buy while using an application. CleverTap partners with IAP platforms to offer a solution that directly sends events related to customer purchases from your app into CleverTap. With this integration, you can analyze events and monitor revenue from your app seamlessly on the CleverTap dashboard.
CleverTap currently partners with [RevenueCat](https://www.revenuecat.com/) for IAP solutions.
