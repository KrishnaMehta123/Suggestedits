# Integrate Gallabox with CleverTap

The integration process involves three steps:

1. [Configure CleverTap in Gallabox](doc:gallabox#configure-clevertap-in-gallabox)
2. [Configure the CleverTap Dashboard](#configure-the-clevertap-dashboard)
3. [Set Up CleverTap Callbacks in Gallabox](#set-up-clevertap-callbacks-in-gallabox)

## Configure CleverTap in Gallabox

Before configuring CleverTap, you must first connect CleverTap within the Gallabox dashboard. This step generates the Webhook URL required to complete the provider setup in CleverTap.

To configure CleverTap in Gallabox:

1. Go to _Integrations_ and select _CleverTap_ in Gallabox Dashboard
2. Click **Connect**, provide an integration name, and submit the configuration.
3. Gallabox generates a _Webhook URL Endpoint_ for your CleverTap connection.
4. Select the WhatsApp channel you want to connect with CleverTap and save the configuration.

> 📘 Note
>
> Gallabox manages the Webhook URL generation and channel mapping. You do not need to manually create API credentials.

Keep the generated Webhook URL Endpoint handy you will use it while configuring CleverTap. For detailed, Gallabox-specific setup steps, refer to [Gallabox’s official documentation](https://docs.gallabox.com/integration/marketing-and-engagement-platforms/clevertap#configuring-clevertap-in-gallabox).

2. In the CleverTap dashboard, go to _Settings_ > _Channels_ > _WhatsApp_ > _Provider Nickname_.
3. Copy the following:

   * **Delivery Report Callback URL**
   * **Inbound Message Callback URL**
4. Paste both URLs into the Gallabox integration form under the corresponding fields.
5. Click **Submit** to save the configuration.
