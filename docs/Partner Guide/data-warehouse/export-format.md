# Overview

This document provides information about the file format and the name format of the files exported to different Data-Warehouse partners.

# Event Export

# File Name Format

The example below shows the file name format for event export:

```text
<export request id>-<timestamp of the export run>-<event name>-<yyyymmdd>-<file index>-<database-id>.json
```

* *Export request ID*: Indicates the export request ID generated when you create a request in the CleverTap dashboard.
* *Timestamp of export run*: Indicates the time when the export was run in EPOCH format.
* *Event name*: Indicates the event type included in the file. For example, the *Charged* event. 
* *File index*: Larger data exports are split into several files. We limit file records to 1,000 K event exports per file.
* *Database ID*: Indicates the database ID of the CleverTap from where the file was exported. 
* *File format*: Indicates the file format exported to the S3 bucket. For instance, CSV file format will be as .csv.gzip
