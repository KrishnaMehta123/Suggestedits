# Overview

The Destination Action framework lets you see and control how Segment sends the event data it receives from your sources to action-based destinations. In other words, it helps to create the following:

- Subscriptions, a set of conditions that act as triggers to send data to the destination 
- Data mappings to format that data for the destination platform

After setting up the destination (action), Segment monitors the data that matches the conditions you create (called "triggers") for the subscription. When the conditions are met, explicit mapping transforms the incoming data into an output format that your destination can use.

# Conversion Timestamps

When mapping actions, you will see a _Convert Timestamps_ setting. When enabled, it converts attributes containing ISO-8601 timestamps to Unix timestamps.

For example, if you send an event with a timestamp of 2006-01-02T18:04:07Z. It is converted to 1136253847. If the timestamp is not in ISO-8601 format, it is not converted. This avoids converting attributes such as phone numbers or IDs.
