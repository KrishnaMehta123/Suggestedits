# Overview

[Outgrow](https://outgrow.co/) is an interactive content platform designed to create surveys, quizzes, calculators, and forms that drive engagement and generate qualified leads. With its no-code builder and customizable templates, Outgrow enables marketers to capture user data seamlessly across channels.

Integrating Outgrow with CleverTap via Zapier allows you to:

- **Capture User Responses Seamlessly**: Automatically sync user responses from Outgrow into CleverTap.
- **Update Profiles in Real Time**: Create or update user profiles based on Outgrow submissions.
- **Trigger Automated Journeys**: Initiate CleverTap journeys such as follow-up or thank-you campaigns based on user actions.
- **Enrich Profiles for Targeting**: Add Outgrow response attributes to CleverTap profiles for improved segmentation and personalization.

# Prerequisites for Integration

The following are the prerequisites for this integration:

- Access to your **Outgrow** account
- Access to an active **Zapier** account
- A CleverTap account with a valid **Account ID** and **Passcode**

# Integrate Outgrow with CleverTap Using Zapier

Suppose you’ve created an interactive quiz in Outgrow to capture user feedback or preferences and want those responses to appear instantly in CleverTap for segmentation or automated campaigns.

This integration connects Outgrow, Zapier, and CleverTap, ensuring that every user submission is automatically transferred to CleverTap, either as profile updates or events, to enable real-time engagement and personalized marketing.

The integration consists of the following four key steps:

1. [Create a Passcode on the CleverTap Dashboard](doc:outgrow#create-a-passcode-on-the-clevertap-dashboard)
2. [Create Interactive Content in Outgrow](doc:outgrow#create-interactive-content-in-outgrow)
3. [Configure CleverTap Campaign](doc:outgrow#configure-clevertap-campaign)
4. [Connect Outgrow and CleverTap via Zapier](doc:outgrow#connect-outgrow-and-clevertap-via-zapier)

## Create a Passcode on the CleverTap Dashboard

CleverTap uses a header-based authentication model to authenticate requests to the API. Every CleverTap API call must include Account ID and Passcode as request headers. To create a passcode, refer to [Create Account Passcode](https://developer.clevertap.com/docs/authentication#create-account-passcode).

## Create Interactive Content in Outgrow

Consider an example where you want to capture user details such as Name, Email, and Feedback through an Outgrow survey embedded in a CleverTap campaign. To do so, perform the following steps:

1. Log in to your Outgrow dashboard and create the content type you want (such as a survey, quiz, or poll).
2. Once the content is ready, go to the _Configure_.
3. Select _Launch in an Email_ and click **Copy HTML Snippet**.

4. The snippet can be used to embed your Outgrow content in a CleverTap campaign.

## Configure CleverTap Campaign

Configure a CleverTap campaign to display your interactive Outgrow content so users can respond directly without leaving the app or email. To do so, perform the following steps:

1. In the CleverTap dashboard, create a new [Email](doc:create-message-email) or [In-App Message](doc:create-message-in-app) campaign that supports HTML.
2. In the _What_ section, select a **Custom HTML Template** such as _Blank Template_.

      "sizing": "75% ",
      "border": true,
      "caption": "Custom HTML Template in CleverTap"
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


3. Replace the existing code with the HTML snippet copied from _Step 3_ of [Create Interactive Content in Outgrow](doc:outgrow#create-interactive-content-in-outgrow).
4. Add dynamic personalization using [Liquid tags](https://docs.clevertap.com/docs/personalize-message-webhooks#liquid-tags) to insert CleverTap profile attributes like name and email.

```html
<iframe width="100%" height="900px" src="<outgrow_link>?name={{ Profile.name | default: \"User\" }}&email={{ Profile.Email | default: \"user@example.com\" }}"></iframe>
```

5. Click **Preview and Test** to verify that the content renders correctly.
6. Publish the campaign only after configuring the Zap as [Create/Update User Profiles](doc:outgrow#createupdate-user-profiles) or [Upload Event](doc:outgrow#upload-event).

## Connect Outgrow and CleverTap via Zapier

Zapier acts as a bridge between Outgrow and CleverTap. When a user submits a response, Zapier captures it and sends the data to CleverTap in real time. You can either update user profiles or log submissions as events.

The integration supports two use cases:

- [Create/Update User Profiles](doc:outgrow#createupdate-user-profiles)
- [Upload Event](doc:outgrow#upload-event)

### Create/Update User Profiles

Use this option if you want Outgrow responses to update user profiles in CleverTap for personalization and segmentation. To do so, perform the following steps:

1. Log in to the [Zapier dashboard](https://zapier.com/app/home) and click **+ Create Zap**. Zapier can connect various applications, including Outgrow.

2. **Set up a Trigger**. To do so, perform the following steps:
   1. Select Outgrow from the App section. This starts the Zap when a trigger event occurs on Outgrow.
   2. Select _Trigger Event_ from the dropdown list and then select _New Lead_ for this use case.
   3. Select Account and sign in using your Outgrow account credentials.

### Upload Event

Consider an example where you want to track form submissions as events in CleverTap instead of updating user profiles. This automation ensures that every submission is logged for analytics and segmentation.

1. Follow _Step 1_ to _Step 4_ from [Create/Update User Profiles](doc:outgrow#createupdate-user-profiles) to configure Outgrow as the trigger.
2. **Select the Action** that the zap must perform after the trigger event occurs. To do so, perform the following steps:

   1. Select _CleverTap_ from the _App_ dropdown.
   2. Select _Upload Event_ from the Action event dropdown.
   3. Select _Account_ to connect the CleverTap account. The Zapier window opens. Enter all the required details to connect to the CleverTap account. Enter the same passcode you obtained during the [Create a Passcode on CleverTap Dashboard](doc:outgrow#create-a-passcode-on-the-clevertap-dashboard) step.
   4. Click **Continue** after successfully connecting your account.

4. Click **Continue**. Click **Test Step** to test the Zap after mapping the fields.
5. Click **Publish**. Also, publish the campaign you have created in [Configure CleverTap Campaign](doc:outgrow#configure-clevertap-campaign). Each submission will now be logged as an event in CleverTap.

# FAQs

### Can I use both profile updates and events together?

Yes. You can set up multiple Zaps, one for updating user profiles and another for uploading events. This way, you can both enrich CleverTap profiles with attributes and log submissions for analytics and campaign triggers.
