# Overview

[LiveClicker](https://www.liveclicker.com/) is a real-time email personalization platform that empowers marketers to deliver dynamic and interactive content directly within emails. It allows you to modify email elements even after delivery—ensuring content is always relevant at the moment of open.

By integrating LiveClicker with CleverTap, you can embed personalized timers, images, or offers that automatically update based on user behavior and real-time data. This integration helps marketing teams drive engagement and conversions by adding contextual urgency and relevance to every campaign.

For example:

- **Countdown Promotions:** Add a LiveTimer countdown to sales or limited-time events to create urgency.
- **Dynamic Offers:** Display personalized discounts based on user location or time of open.
- **Event Reminders:** Update content dynamically until the event start time.

***

# Use Case: Countdown Timer for Flash Sales

Consider an example where an email campaign promotes a 24-hour flash sale. Using the **CleverTap \<> LiveClicker** integration, marketers can embed a countdown timer that updates in real-time for each recipient, showing the exact time left when the email is opened.

This creates urgency and improves conversion rates by motivating users to act before the timer expires.
