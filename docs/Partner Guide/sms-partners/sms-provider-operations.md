# Archive Service Providers

You can archive any current SMS service providers from the SMS settings. Archiving the SMS service provider stops any active _Campaigns_ or _Journeys_ for this provider. The archived provider will not be available for use in the future. However, it will still retain the provider stats. 

Follow the steps to archive an SMS service provider:

1. From the CleverTap dashboard, navigate to _Settings > Channels > SMS > Providers_ tab. 
2. Click the ellipsis next to the provider. 
3. Select _Archive_ from the list. 

# Delete Service Providers

You can delete any of the current SMS service providers from the SMS settings. Deleting the SMS service provider will remove all existing data from our system and stop any active _Campaigns_ or _Journeys_. The deleted provider will not be available for use in the future.

Follow the steps to delete an SMS service provider:

1. From the CleverTap dashboard, navigate to _Settings > Channels > SMS > Providers_ tab. 
2. Click the ellipsis next to the provider. 
3. Select _Delete_ from the list.

Follow the steps to edit provider settings:

1. From the CleverTap dashboard, navigate to _Settings > Channels > SMS > Providers_ tab. 
2. Click the ellipsis next to the provider.

6. Click **Save**.
