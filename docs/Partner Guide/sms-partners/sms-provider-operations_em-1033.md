# Operations

The operations for SMS providers are as follows:

## Edit Settings

Edit the SMS settings to change *Provider credentials*.

Follow the steps to edit provider settings:

1. From the CleverTap dashboard, navigate to *Settings* > *Channels* > *SMS* > Providers\_ tab. 
2. Click the ellipsis next to the provider.

4. Change the required information. 
5. Click **Send Test SMS** to check that the provider is working correctly. 
6. Click **Save**.

## Mark as Default

Set a service provider as default so that the same provider appears pre-selected from the dropdown by default in the campaign creation workflow for delivering your SMS

To set up a default SMS service provider:

1. From the CleverTap dashboard, navigate to *Settings* > *Channels* > *SMS* > *Providers* tab.

## Archive Service Providers

You can archive any current SMS service providers from the SMS settings. Archiving the SMS service provider stops any active *Campaigns* or *Journeys* for this provider. The archived provider will not be available for use in the future. However, it will still retain the provider stats.
