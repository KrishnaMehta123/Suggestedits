This integration allows customers to create a support ticket in their Zendesk account when a user provides negative feedback. Currently, CleverTap partners with [Zendesk](doc:zendesk) to enable support ticket creation from within the CleverTap dashboard. A ticket is created whenever a user submits negative feedback through a Rating In-app campaign.
