Dynamic Content is any text, audio, or video content that changes based on user behavior and preferences. For example, personalized app stories on the OTT platform are generated using Storyly. CleverTap integrates with [Storyly](doc:storyly) to deliver such marketing content dynamically in a full-screen and interactive format in their mobile apps or on their websites.
