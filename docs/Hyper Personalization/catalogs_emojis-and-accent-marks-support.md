## Overview

A catalog provides the ability to personalize campaigns with dynamic information in messages from product prices to inventory levels. You can create a new catalog by uploading a file with one row for each item in your catalog. A catalog can be uploaded directly on the CleverTap dashboard via a CSV file that is generated by your inventory management system on your servers.

# Download a Sample Catalog

# Map Catalog Columns

After uploading the catalog, you must map the catalog column with the associated event and property on CleverTap (for example, map the *Name* field of the catalog to the event property *Product Name* of the event *Product Viewed*).

1. Navigate to *Settings* > *Catalogs* and select the uploaded catalog. 
2. From the map catalog section, select the catalog columns to map. 

The following is the sample mapping of the Product Location Catalog where the identity column from the catalog must be mapped to any other column in any product catalog:

<Image title="Select Product Location Catalog columns to map.png" alt="A prompt displays from where you need to click Map to map the columns of your uploaded Product Location Catalog" border={true} src="https://files.readme.io/ccbc79b-Select_Product_Location_Catalog_columns_to_map.png">

> 📘 Required Location Column in a Product Catalog
>
> A product catalog must have a specific field that can be mapped to the identity column in a product location catalog. Also, there can be multiple mappings that can be done with the same product location catalog.

The following is the sample mapping for the Product Catalog:

<Image title="Select_Product_Catalog_columns_to_map.png" alt="A prompt displays from where you need to click Map to map the columns of your uploaded Product Catalog" border={true} src="https://files.readme.io/872cfac-Select_Product_Catalog_columns_to_map.png">

> 📘 Key Points to Consider for Product Catalog
>
> * You can map multiple catalog columns to a CleverTap event property.
> * A mapped event property can only belong to the same event.

3. Click **Save Catalog** after the mapping is complete. 

# Catalog Best Practices

When uploading a catalog, consider the following best practices: some items are mandatory, and others are recommendations.

## Mandatory Practices

The following are some of the mandatory practices when working with Catalogs on the CleverTap dashboard:

* The first row in the file must contain the header fields separated by commas. The subsequent rows are fields with your individual catalog items in them, also separated by commas. Each row identifies one item in your catalog.

* There are three mandatory columns for each catalog type.

  * *For a product catalog*:
    * Identity: This is the unique identifier associated with each item.
    * Name: This is the name of the item.
    * ImageURL: This is the item image.

  * *For a product  location catalog*:
    * Identity: This is the location ID, such as a store ID.
    * Latitude: This is the geographic coordinate that specifies the north-south position.
    * Longitude: This is the geographic coordinate that specifies the east-west position.

* There can be a total of 20 columns in your catalog. The following are some tangible benefits of adding a large number of custom fields when uploading your record:
  * Every field in the catalog can be used for sending personalized messages to your users. 
  * Also, every field could be used to create recommendations for a filtered set of items in your catalog. For example, you could have a field that identifies the things that are the *flavor of the season*. 
  * You could create a recommendation to serve only the *flavor of the season* from the catalog. You could also exclude items that are not best suited to be recommended to a wider audience (for example, rated content).

* The catalog must be in a CSV format. 

* The images added within the *ImageURL* field must adhere to the following guidelines to render correctly:
  * [Aspect Ratio for In-App Campaigns](doc:create-message-inapp).
  * Others: The aspect ratio of images must be 16: 9 or 1:1, depending on your campaign requirement.

## Recommended Practices

The following are recommended practices:

* You can add custom fields in addition to the mandatory fields. 
* It is highly recommended that you keep your catalog updated to ensure that:
  * The [recommendations](doc:recommendations) are accurate and useful to users. Also, it is important to avoid showing recommendations for items that have expired or are currently out of stock.
  * The [Catalog Data Ingestion](doc:catalog-data-ingestion) is accurate.
