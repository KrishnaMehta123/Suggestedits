# Overview

CleverTap provides a set of default dashboards, such as the [Today View](doc:today-view), which you can use to quickly analyze user activity in your application. Custom Dashboards is a new feature in CleverTap that allows you to create and customize your own board. 

Each Custom Dashboard you create is composed of cards, which are widgets that you can pin to the board to track metrics you are most interested in. You can pin cards that track [events](doc:events), [funnels](doc:funnels), and [segments](doc:segments-2).

For example, let's say you want to create a Custom Dashboard to analyze App Launch events over the past 30 days. You could add a histogram card, which will show you the distribution of App Launch events. You could also add a line graph card to see the number of App Launch events per day.

After you build your Custom Dashboard, you can pin the board to the left navigation menu of your CleverTap account for quick access next time you login. You can also share the board with other people in your organization.

# Build Your First Custom Dashboard

## Step 1: Create a New Board

From the left navigation menu, click Custom Boards. To create a new board, click on + Board.

Name your board, click Public, and then click Add.

> 👍 Board Visibility
>
> There are two options for board visibility: Public or Private. Setting a board to public will make the board visible throughout your organization. A private board will only be visible to the creator.

## Step 2: Pin a Card

When you create your new board, you will see an empty board. 

If you click on Events, Segments, Funnels, or Find people within the empty board, you will be taken to that page in your CleverTap account. 

<Image title="Custom_Dashboard_Empty.png" alt={608} className="border" border={true} src="https://files.readme.io/876454b-Custom_Dashboard_Empty.png" />

Click on Segments. You will now be on the Segments page in your CleverTap account, where you will see a list of Segments you have created.

<Image title="Custom_Dashboard_Segment.png" alt={1176} className="border" border={true} src="https://files.readme.io/06d8f80-Custom_Dashboard_Segment.png" />

Click on one of the Segments you have created. You will be taken to the Report page for that Segment. Now click on the Pin icon. 

<Image title="Custom_Dashboard_Segment_pin.png" alt={1189} className="border" border={true} src="https://files.readme.io/3e83064-Custom_Dashboard_Segment_pin.png" />

Name the card and choose the board of your choice. You can also create a new board at this step. 

<Image title="Custom_Dashboard_Segment_pin_Name.png" alt={562} className="border" border={true} src="https://files.readme.io/4266aa8-Custom_Dashboard_Segment_pin_Name.png" />

## Step 3: Your Boards

Repeat step 2 to add another card to your board. 

To get quicker access to this board next time you login to CleverTap, click the My Boards tab.
