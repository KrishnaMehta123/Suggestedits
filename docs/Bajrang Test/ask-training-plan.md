# Overview

A comprehensive 4-week training plan to onboard the new technical writer on the Ask AI project, specifically focusing on the query response monitoring and correction process. This plan provides a structured approach to gradually onboarding the new technical writer and ensures they’re fully equipped to manage the response correction process independently.
