As of 2024, the CleverTap Technical Writing team uses **ReadMe** as the primary platform for creating, managing, and publishing product documentation. ReadMe provides a structured and collaborative environment that supports the entire documentation lifecycle—from drafting to publishing.  

### Projects on ReadMe

Our documentation is organized into four projects to separate staging and production environments, ensuring clarity and precision during the writing and review processes:  

1. **User Guide - Staging**  
   - Purpose: A workspace for drafting and reviewing user-focused documentation before publication.  
   - Audience: Internal stakeholders, reviewers, and approvers.  
   - Visibility: Restricted to staging until the content is finalized.  

2. **User Guide - Production**  
   - Purpose: The live repository of user-facing documentation.  
   - Audience: End-users accessing published guides for product features, configurations, and workflows.  
   - Visibility: Fully indexed and publicly accessible.  

3. **Developer Documentation - Staging**  
   - Purpose: A development environment for drafting and revising technical content aimed at developers.  
   - Audience: Internal teams and technical reviewers.  
   - Visibility: Restricted to staging until approved for release.  

4. **Developer Documentation - Production**  
   - Purpose: The official, live repository of developer-facing documentation.  
   - Audience: Developers integrating CleverTap products or APIs.  
   - Visibility: Indexed, publicly accessible, and optimized for discoverability.  

This framework ensures that CleverTap’s documentation process is robust, organized, and user-focused, laying the groundwork for creating clear, consistent, and reliable content.  

Following this, refer to the **Writing and Publishing Documentation** section for a detailed guide on creating content within this framework.
