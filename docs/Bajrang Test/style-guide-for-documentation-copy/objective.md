# Overview

This guide outlines the standards and procedures our team follows to create clear, concise, and effective documentation for our products. We aim to provide valuable resources that help users and developers understand and use our software efficiently.

The CleverTap style guide for technical documentation provides guidelines for how documentation should be presented from both a graphic and a language perspective. The purpose of a style guide is to ensure that multiple contributors create in a clear and cohesive way that reflects the corporate style and ensures brand consistency with everything from design to writing.

Our team is dedicated to producing the following types of content:

## Product Documentation

- **Educate customers and employees** by offering clear, well-structured content that reduces the learning curve.
- **Reduce technical support issues** and customer calls by providing easy-to-understand troubleshooting resources and guides.

## UX Content
