## Voice

Our voice remains consistent across all documentation, reflecting CleverTap's brand identity.

### Authoritative and Professional

We convey confidence in our expertise without being condescending. Users should trust our documentation to be accurate, well-researched, and reliable.

**Do:**

- Use precise, factual language to establish credibility.
- Ensure all information is verified and up to date before publishing.
- Write in active voice to create a clear and authoritative tone.

**Avoid:**

- Making unverifiable claims or using exaggerated language.
- Using passive voice, which weakens the clarity of instructions.

**Example:**

- _Correct:_ "CleverTap allows businesses to segment users based on real-time behavior."
- _Incorrect:_ "CleverTap is the most powerful platform that will transform your engagement strategy!"

### Clear and Concise

Documentation should be easy to read and scan. Users don't have time for unnecessary words, complex phrasing, or redundancy.

**Do:**

- Use short, direct sentences with simple words instead of jargon.
- Eliminate redundancy and unnecessary words.
- Structure content with clear headings, bullet points, and whitespace.

**Avoid:**

- Repetitive statements that don't add value.
- Flowery language that complicates understanding.

**Example of Redundancy:**

- _Incorrect:_ "The process of freeing a stuck vehicle that has been stuck..."
- _Correct:_ "The process of freeing a stuck vehicle consists of..."

**Example of Flowery Language:**

- _Incorrect:_ "High-quality learning environments are a necessary precondition for the facilitation of effective education."
- _Correct:_ "Good schools help people learn."

### Approachable and Supportive

We aim to guide users without overwhelming them. Our tone should be friendly, helpful, and solution-oriented.

**Do:**

- Use direct language that makes instructions easy to follow.
- Write in a supportive and reassuring tone, especially in troubleshooting scenarios.
- Use "you" in instructions to engage users directly.

**Avoid:**

- Sounding too robotic, formal, or distant.
- Overly casual or playful language.

**Example:**

- _Correct:_ "If you encounter an error while integrating the SDK, check the logs and try the following solutions."
- _Incorrect:_ "Users encountering an error during SDK integration should check their logs and attempt to resolve the issue."

**Error Handling Example:**

- _Correct:_ "It looks like the API key is missing. Double-check your credentials and try again."
- _Incorrect:_ "An error has occurred due to an invalid API key."

## Tone

While our voice remains consistent, our tone adjusts based on context.

### Instructional Content (Guides, Tutorials, How-To Articles)

**Tone:** Direct, neutral, clear.

**Usage:** When explaining a process, use second-person ("you") to make instructions engaging.

**Example:**

- _Correct:_ "To send a push notification, go to the Campaigns section and click 'Create Campaign'."
- _Incorrect:_ "The user must navigate to the Campaigns section to create a campaign."

### Feature Announcements and Updates

**Tone:** Enthusiastic, engaging, but professional.

**Usage:** When announcing new features, use "we" sparingly to maintain an inclusive feel.

**Example:**

- _Correct:_ "We're excited to introduce a new feature that makes user segmentation even easier!"
- _Incorrect:_ "This new feature will completely change how you use CleverTap!"

### Troubleshooting and Error Messages

**Tone:** Reassuring, empathetic, solution-focused.

**Usage:** Acknowledge the issue and offer clear solutions without blame.

**Example:**

- _Correct:_ "We understand this issue can be frustrating. Try these steps to resolve it."
- _Incorrect:_ "Something went wrong. Please try again."

### Instructional Best Practices

To ensure clarity and usability:

- Use action verbs to guide users.
- Keep text short and descriptive.
- Avoid unnecessary jargon—use plain language.
- Use headings and whitespace for readability.
- Ensure illustrations and text align.

## Inclusive and Accessible Writing

CleverTap's documentation should be welcoming to all audiences, ensuring clarity and accessibility.

**Do:**

- Write in plain language—avoid internal terminology that external users may not understand.
- Ensure accessibility by considering screen readers and mobile usability.
- Use gender-neutral and inclusive language (e.g., "they" instead of "he/she").
- Avoid cultural assumptions—write for a global audience.

**Accessibility Checklist:**

- Can users scan and understand the document easily?
- If someone can't see images or colors, is the message still clear?
- Does the document work well on mobile devices?
