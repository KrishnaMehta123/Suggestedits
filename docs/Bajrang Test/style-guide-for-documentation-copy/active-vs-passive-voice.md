# Overview

In technical documentation, clarity and directness are paramount. Utilizing **active voice** ensures that sentences are straightforward and easy to understand. However, there are instances where **passive voice** is appropriate.

## Active Voice

Active voice occurs when the subject of the sentence performs the action. This construction is direct and vigorous, making it the preferred choice for most content.

**Example:**

* **Active:** The system **displays** a confirmation message.

* **Passive:** A confirmation message **is displayed** by the system.

In the active sentence, "the system" (subject) performs the action of displaying, resulting in a clear and concise statement.

## Passive Voice

Passive voice occurs when the subject of the sentence receives the action. While generally less direct, passive voice can be useful in specific contexts:

* **Emphasizing the Action or Result:** When the outcome is more important than the performer.

  * *Example:* "The update was released ahead of schedule."

* **Unknown or Irrelevant Actor:** When the doer of the action is unknown or not essential to the context.

  * *Example:* "The file was corrupted."

* **Avoiding Blame or Condescension:** Particularly in error messages or user instructions, to maintain a neutral tone.

  * *Example:* "The password entered is invalid."

In these cases, passive voice appropriately shifts focus from the subject to the action or condition.

## Guidelines

* **Prefer Active Voice:** Use active constructions to promote clarity and engagement.

  * *Example:* "Click the **Save** button to store your changes."

* **Use Passive Voice When Appropriate:** Apply passive voice selectively, based on the context and desired emphasis.

  * *Example:* "Changes are saved automatically every 10 minutes."

## Style Considerations

### Formality

* Use a moderate level of formality—professional, but not overly rigid.
* Avoid first-person ("I" or "we"), except when discussing CleverTap's updates.
* Use third-person when describing features but second-person ("you") when giving instructions.

**Example:**

* *Correct:* "The product provides the ability to create multiple user segments."
* *Incorrect:* "The product allows you to create multiple user segments."

**Avoiding "Please":**

* Do not use "please" in technical documentation—it adds unnecessary formality.
* Be polite but direct in instructions.

**Example:**

* *Correct:* "Click 'Submit' to save your changes."
* *Incorrect:* "Please click 'Submit' to save your changes."

By thoughtfully choosing between active and passive voice, documentation can be both clear and user-focused, enhancing the overall user experience.
