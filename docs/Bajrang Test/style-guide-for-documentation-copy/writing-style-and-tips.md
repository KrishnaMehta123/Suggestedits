This guide outlines the step-by-step process for creating and publishing high-quality documentation that adheres to CleverTap’s standards. Following these guidelines ensures clarity, accuracy, and consistency while meeting the needs of our diverse audience.  

## 1. Understand Your Audience

Effective documentation begins with a thorough understanding of your audience. Ask yourself the following questions:  

- **Who will use this document?** Identify whether the target audience includes end-users, developers, partners, or other stakeholders.  
- **What is their level of expertise?** Tailor the content to their familiarity with the product, providing technical depth or simplicity as needed.  
- **What are their goals?** Focus on solving problems or achieving outcomes that matter to your audience.  

Always write with your target audience in mind. Understand their level of technical expertise:

- **Beginner**: Avoid jargon and explain all technical terms.
- **Intermediate**: Introduce more complex concepts but still offer background information.
- **Advanced**: Assume familiarity with core concepts but clarify anything that might be new or unusual.

Tailor your documentation to solve problems from the reader's perspective. Always provide context when introducing features or solutions.

**Example:**

- **Beginner**: "Click the **Submit** button to complete the process. This will save your settings."
- **Intermediate**: "Click **Submit** to save your settings, which will apply changes across the application."
- **Advanced**: "Click **Submit** to commit all changes; this action triggers the application to refresh with the updated configurations."

Align the tone, style, and depth of detail to resonate with the intended audience, ensuring the content is engaging and actionable.  

## 2. Define the Purpose of the Document

A clear purpose ensures your writing stays focused and relevant. Determine whether the document is:  

- Explaining a feature.  
- Providing step-by-step guidance.  
- Offering troubleshooting solutions.  
- Highlighting best practices or tips.  
- Communicating updates or release notes.  

Set measurable objectives for the document. For example, “Enable users to configure feature X in under five minutes” or “Explain API integration with minimal errors.”  

## 3. Confirm the Release Status of the Feature

Before starting, verify the release status of the feature or topic:  

- **Coordinate with the Product Manager (PM):** Determine if the feature is in private beta, general availability, or still under development.  
- **Create the appropriate document:**  
  - For **public features**, ensure the document is **indexed** and discoverable.  
  - For **private beta features**, create an **unindexed** document to limit visibility until the feature is publicly available.  

This ensures users access the right information at the right time without confusion.  

## 4. Structure the Document

Well-structured documentation enhances usability. Start by creating a clear and logical outline or skeleton. Include the following elements:  

- **Title:** Informative and concise, reflecting the document’s content.  
- **Introduction:** Provide context and explain the document’s purpose.  
- **Sections and Subsections:** Use headings and subheadings to organize content logically.  
- **Visuals:** Incorporate images, diagrams, or videos where necessary to aid comprehension.  
- **Summary or Conclusion:** Recap key points or next steps.  

Use a hierarchical approach that enables users to scan the document for the information they need quickly.  

## 5. Draft the Content

Write a comprehensive first draft while adhering to these principles:  

- Use **American English** throughout.  
- Work in the staging environment to enable thorough reviews and edits. For more details, refer to the [Documentation Framework Overview](<>).
- Prioritize accuracy and clarity, avoiding overly technical jargon unless appropriate for the audience.  
- Ensure the draft is placed correctly:  
  - Assign it to the relevant project (e.g., User Documentation, Developer Documentation, Partner Documentation).  
  - Position it within the appropriate section in the left-hand navigation for logical discovery.  

## 6. Review and Refine

Refinement is a critical step to ensure quality.  

- **Self-review:** Check for clarity, grammar, spelling, and adherence to style guidelines.  
- **Content review:** Validate the technical accuracy of the information provided.  
- **Hierarchy and navigation check:** Confirm the document is correctly placed and follows logical navigation paths.  
- **Feedback incorporation:** Address feedback from peers and subject-matter experts.  

This iterative process ensures the document is polished and ready for further review.  

## 7. Submit for Review

Once the draft is refined:  

- Share a **clean version** with the designated reviewers.  
- Include any necessary context or background to help them evaluate the document effectively.  
- Promptly address reviewer feedback and finalize the document for publication.  

## 8. Finalize and Publish

After approval, transition the document from staging to production.  

- **Publishing:**  
  - Ensure the content is accurate, up-to-date, and complete.  
  - Confirm alignment between the staging and production environments to avoid discrepancies. For more details, refer to the [Documentation Framework Overview](<>).
- **Link verification:**  
  - Check that all internal and external links are functioning correctly in the production environment.  

Post-publication, monitor user feedback or analytics to continuously improve the documentation.
