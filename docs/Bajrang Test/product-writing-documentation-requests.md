This document outlines the process for submitting requests to the CleverTap Product Writing team. We've established a streamlined procedure to ensure that documentation requests are efficiently managed, tracked, and completed in a timely manner. Following these steps will help avoid delays and ensure clear communication with the team.

This process is only for documentation-related tasks. Any project requests, such as those involving significant effort or scoping, should be directed to Girish Mehta. For tasks like sprint assignments, documentation feedback, or customer feedback, use the appropriate channels or consult with the team directly.

# Steps to Create a JIRA Ticket for Documentation Requests

To submit a documentation request to the Product Writing team, follow the steps below to create a ticket in JIRA. This ensures that the task is tracked, assigned, and completed efficiently.

1. Click on the following link to access the documentation board:\
   [Documentation Board in JIRA](https://wizrocket.atlassian.net/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=73)

2. Click **Create** at the top of the board.\
   Ensure the **Project** is set to **Techpubs (TEC)** and the **Issue Type** is set to **Task**.

3. In the **Summary** field, provide a clear and concise description of the request, specifying what documentation is needed.

4. Attach any relevant documents or screenshots by clicking **Browse** to help clarify the request.

5. Select an **Assignee** from the available team members who will be responsible for the task.

6. Set the **Priority** level (P0, P1, P2, P3, P4, or AHOD).  
   * **P0**: Critical issues  
   * **P1**: High priority  
   * **P2**: Medium priority  
   * **P3**: Low priority  
   * **P4**: Lowest priority  
   * **AHOD**: Urgent high-level documentation requests

7. Select an appropriate **Label** for the task based on its nature.\
   For example, use **DocSprint** for sprint-related tasks and **DocImprovement** for tasks aimed at improving documentation.

8. Select the **Parent** task (if applicable), the relevant **Sprint**, and the **Doc Peer Reviewer** (if applicable).

9. Make sure the **Techpub Writer** field is filled in. This ensures the task is assigned to the appropriate writer and appears on the board under their name.

10. Set the **Resolution** status to reflect the task’s current state, such as: Done, Won't Do or In Progress.

11. Select the **Due Date** for when the task needs to be completed.

12. Click **Create**.

# Action Items After Task Completion

Once a documentation task is completed, there are a few important actions to ensure proper tracking and communication. Follow the steps below based on the type of task.

* **For Sprint Tasks**: Once a sprint task is complete, update the [Tech Docs QA 2024](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eZsxqqsQtUEd5pzwVbX1ByTAX3SiExXtfUdfm7lQy3c/edit?usp=sharing) spreadsheet to mark it as completed.

* **For DocImprovement Tasks**: After completing a DocImprovement task, provide an update in the #documentation Slack channel so the team can review the changes.
