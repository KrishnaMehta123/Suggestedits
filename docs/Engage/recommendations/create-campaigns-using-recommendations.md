Once the recommendations have been published, you can use them in your engagement workflow

The real power of the feature is to be able to create highly personalized and contextual recommendations for your user base.

# Step 1 Access recommendations within a campaign

As you create the content (or the 'what') within the campaign, you can type in '@' to personalize your message.\
Here, along with the profile/event personalization, you will see "+ Create" within the section "Recommendation content"

# Step 2 Create recommendation content

* Here, you can pick from the recommendations which have already been published
* Next, choose the event that you wish to trigger the recommendation. 
* The most recent (latest) event property will be used to trigger the recommendation. E.g. Recommend an item to the user based on the item that the user last charged. 
* Here, you will be able to select only those events you mapped to the catalog on which the chosen recommendation is running.
* You can decide the sequence of item to be served up to the user out of the list of items that can be recommended. E.g. Serve up the 1st item from the list of recommended items.

# Step 3 Choose the fields to personalize your message

* Once you've created a recommendation, you can choose the particular fields from the catalog that you wish to use in your personalized message.
* When the campaign is sent out, the fields will be replaced and the message will contain the personalized fields for each product. 
* E.g. You can send out a recommended video to the user with the video name and thumbnail image based on the last videos s/he watched.

You can now publish the campaign
