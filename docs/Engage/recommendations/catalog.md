You can create a catalog by uploading a file with one row for each item in your catalog. This catalog can be uploaded directly on the CleverTap dashboard via a csv file that is generated by your Inventory Management System at your servers.

To create new catalogs, go to Catalogs under the Engage section on the dashboard.

## Mapping catalog fields to event properties

Now, you need to map a catalog field to an event and property. This is required in order to -

* Map the catalog column with the associated event and property on CleverTap. e.g. map the 'Name' field of the catalog to the event property 'Product Name' of the event 'Product Viewed'.

<Image title="Map Events pop-up.jpg" alt={542} className="border" border={true} src="https://files.readme.io/b754ce0-Map_Events_pop-up.jpg" />

* You can map more than 1 column of the catalog to a CleverTap event property
* Multiple event properties being mapped could belong to either the same event or multiple events

> 📘 Why should I map multiple columns?
>
> This is allowed so that you can create multiple campaigns, on the same catalog, where each campaign provides a different set of recommendations based on the last event performed

## Catalog Best Practices

There are certain best practices that we recommend, while uploading the catalog

* **Mandatory**: The first row in your file must contain the header fields separated by commas. The subsequent rows are fields with your individual catalog items in them, also separated by commas. Each row identifies one item in your catalog.
* **Mandatory**: There are 3 mandatory fields in the catalog. These fields are required in order to successfully upload a catalog 
  * Identity: This is the unique identifier associated with each item
  * Name: This is the name of the item that is mostly displayed on the notification content
  * ImageURL: This is the item image that typically shows in the notification content
  * **Recommended**: You can add custom fields in addition to the mandatory fields. 
* **Mandatory**: There can be a total of 20 fields in your catalog.
* There are tangible benefits to adding a large number of custom fields while uploading your catalog
  * Every field in the catalog can be used for sending personalized messages to your users. 
  * Also, every field could be used to create recommendations for a filtered set of items in your catalog. For example, you could have a field that identifies the items that are the 'flavour of the season'. 
  * You could potentially create a recommendation to serve only the 'flavour of the season' from the catalog. You could also choose to exclude certain items which are not best suited to be recommended to a wider audience e.g. 'Rated' content.
* **Recommended**: It's highly recommended that you keep your catalog updated. This is to ensure that the recommendations are accurate and useful to users. Also, it is important to avoid showing recommendations for items that have expired or are currently out of stock.
* **Mandatory**: The catalog must be in .csv format. 
* The images added within the ImageURL field should adhere to the following guidelines in order to render well:
  * [In App Aspect ratio] ([https://docs.clevertap.com/docs/inapp-campaigns#section-template-aspect-ratio-and-image-size-guide](https://docs.clevertap.com/docs/inapp-campaigns#section-template-aspect-ratio-and-image-size-guide)):\*\*
  * Others: Aspect ratio of images should be either 16: 9 or 1:1 depending on your campaign requirement.
