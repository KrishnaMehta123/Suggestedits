#Clone a Journey

The quickest way to create a Journey is to simply clone a similar Journey and be on your way! A Journey is a sequence of multiple campaigns and sometimes it may involve a lot of flows and communication channels. There may be instances where you may want to recreate an existing Journey with minor modifications. 

See how to clone a Journey in 3 easy steps. 

Step 1. [Search for a Journey](https://docs.clevertap.com/docs/operations-on-a-journey#section-search-for-a-journey) from the Journey List.
 
Step 2. Clone the Journey.
You can select and clone a Journey from the Journey list page. You can also use the Clone button from within a Journey.
