## Overview

The query builder is at the core of segmentation in CleverTap. Using this tool marketers can segment their users logically based on their interests or certain events at a particular time.

# Build a Query

To build a query, perform the following steps:

1. From the dashboard, navigate to *Segments* > *Find People*.
2. Select the appropriate interest, event, and/or property below:

## Users Who Like

Segment users by their interests (powered by our AI tools).

## Users Who Did

Segment users by the event they performed.

You can choose *All (AND)*.

You can choose *Any (OR)*.

> 📘 And/Or Conditions
>
> There is an *And/Or* condition in the *Users who did* section but not in the *Did not do* section because *And* and *Or* conditions both mean *And* in the *Did not do* section.

## Users Who Did Not Do

Segment users by the event they have not performed yet.

## Display Common Properties

Segment users by selecting common properties across them.

3. Click **View details**.
