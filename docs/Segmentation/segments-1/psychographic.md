# Interest by Event Property

This section covers the interest by event property with the *Predominantly* option or the *At Least* option.

## Predominantly

You can use the *Predominantly* option to only select users who have mostly purchased shoes out of their total purchases. The selected users may have purchased other items but they have purchased shoes the most out of their total purchases.

# Interest by Time of Day 

This section covers the interest by time of day with the *Predominantly* option.

## Predominantly

You can use the *Time of the Day* and *Predominantly* options to segment users who have purchased items mostly between 6 PM to 9 PM.

This provides a set of users who have made most of their purchases between 6 PM and 9 PM. These users may have purchased during other times of the day but most of their purchases have happened in this time slot.
