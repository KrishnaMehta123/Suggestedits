**@DOCS NOTES**

* IMPORTANT NOTE: PER SUNIL, USE THE CAMPAIGN REDESIGN WIP DOC AS THE SOURCE OF TRUTH: [https://docs.clevertap.com/docs/segments\_20](https://docs.clevertap.com/docs/segments_20) (DK IS REVIEWING THIS PAGE AS OF JUL 28, 2021)

## Overview

A segment in CleverTap is a group of users whose actions performed, actions not performed, or user profile properties match a set of defined criteria. For example, a segment can be users who launched the app for the first time in the past 30 days. A more complex segment could be users who live in New York, were acquired via a Facebook campaign in April, transacted three or more times in May and June, and have not transacted in the past two weeks.

After you have identified segments of interest, you can save and then target them with any type of messaging campaign. You can also trend segments over time to understand how a segment behaves in response to your marketing initiatives. The entire CleverTap dashboard can be filtered by any segment you create, including any of our analytics features.
