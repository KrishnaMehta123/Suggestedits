# Create Segment Using *Display Common Properties*

For example, you can run a query to look for users who are part of your loyalty program and filter by a common user property for customer type with various tiers, such as silver, gold, or platinum. 

To create this segment, perform the following steps:

1. From the dashboard, navigate to *Segments* > *Segments*.
2. Click **+ Segment**, then select a segment.
3. Under *Display Common Properties*, select the appropriate properties.
4. Click **Save Segment**.

As a different example, you can look for users in a particular radius from a chosen location, such as the airport. 

Repeat the steps from above, but this time, under the *Display Common Properties* section, choose the geography radius filter and search your location or drop a pin on the map. Pull the circle to choose the radius that you want to target around this chosen location.
