@DOCS: ONCE APPROVED BY PM, REPLACE EXISTING USER DOC [https://docs.clevertap.com/docs/custom-list-segments](https://docs.clevertap.com/docs/custom-list-segments) AND MOVE TO CORRECT SPOT IN THE TABLE OF CONTENT.

## Overview

Custom list segments are custom segments that you create based on your requirements and analytics. These can be users with the required interests and demographics. You can use these segments to re-engage your users without having to apply the same conditions or filters again. 

## Examples

A custom list segment can be useful in many use cases, including:

* A retail business running SMS campaigns: As a retail business, you may be generating user lists at your point of sale across different cities. You can upload city-based segments and run personalized campaigns to re-engage these users. 
* Engagement integrated with your segmentation engine: You may have a segmentation engine or a data science engine that has created a user set to engage with a specific message. In this case, you can use custom list segments to seamlessly create segments from your custom lists and schedule engagement for them. 
* Real-time sync for engagement with your in-house segments: An app streaming a football match can have millions of users. If your target audience is 10,000 users and the next match is even more interesting, you could expect a surge in users where you end up with a handy list of 15,000 users. You can create a segment using this list and run a campaign immediately.  

# Create Custom List Segments

You can create a custom list segment by uploading user lists via the dashboard or an API. 

## File Format

The user list for your segment must follow a specific format. You can upload the profiles with identity type as GUID or CleverTap ID (g) or the identity (i). 

The format of the CSV file is as follows:

<Table align={["left","left"]}>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>
        Type
      </th>

      <th>
        Identity
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        g
      </td>

      <td>
        a1e2723cba7c4518bea8ef95b036ac83
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        i
      </td>

      <td>
        identity
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</Table>

The type and identity columns are mandatory for uploading a custom list segment.
