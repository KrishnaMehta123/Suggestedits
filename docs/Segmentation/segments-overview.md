Segments in CleverTap are groups of users who share similar characteristics, behaviors, or attributes. Segments can be created based on various criteria, including demographic information, app usage behavior, location, device type, and more. 

Segments are an essential tool for businesses to understand and engage their customers. By creating segments based on various criteria, businesses can target users with personalized campaigns and increase engagement and retention rates. With CleverTap’s powerful segmentation capabilities, businesses can gain valuable insights into their users and create more effective marketing strategies.

# Segmentation Criteria

You can segment users based on the following criteria:

## User Attributes

User attributes are characteristics or properties that are associated with each user profile. These attributes can be predefined or custom and include information such as name, email, age, gender, location, device type, app version, and more. Segments can be created based on one or more user attributes, allowing businesses to target users who meet specific criteria.

## Events

Events are actions that users take within an app, such as making a purchase, adding an item to their cart, or signing up for a newsletter. Segments can be created based on one or more events, allowing businesses to target users who have performed specific actions or have not performed certain actions.

## User Behavior

User behavior refers to how users interact with an app over time. Segments can be created based on user behavior, such as the number of sessions, time spent in the app, or the frequency of app usage. This allows businesses to target highly engaged users or those who may need additional encouragement to continue using the app.

## Predictive Segments

Predictive segments use machine learning algorithms to identify groups of users who are likely to perform a specific action in the future. For example, a predictive segment could be created to target users who are likely to make a purchase in the next 30 days based on their past behavior and app usage patterns.

# Types of Segments

There are three types of segments in CleverTap:

- [Past Behavior Segments](doc:segments-overview#past-behavior-segments)
- [Live User Segments](doc:segments-overview#live-user-segments)
- [Custom List Segments](doc:segments-overview#custom-list-segments)

## Past Behavior Segments

Past behavior segments are users grouped by their actions in the past. You can group users based on a single activity to complex combinations of actions, inactions, and user properties. For more information, refer to [Past Behavior Segments](doc:segments#past-behavior-segments).

## Live User Segments

Live User Segments are users grouped by their live behavior. Live user segments let you track the real-time actions in your app. For more information, refer to [Live User Segments](doc:segments#live-user-segments).

## Custom List Segments

Custom List Segments are custom segments that you can create based on your requirements and analytics. You can create a custom list segment by uploading user lists via the dashboard or API. For more information, refer to [Custom List Segments](doc:custom-list-segments).

# Find People

One of the features of the CleverTap dashboard is the ability to find specific people based on their attributes and behavior. To find people in the CleverTap dashboard, you can use the People Search feature. This feature allows you to search for users based on their properties such as name, email, device, location, and custom attributes. You can also use the People Search feature to filter users based on their behavior, such as the actions they have taken on your app or website, their engagement level, and their purchase history.

Once you have found the people you are looking for, you can view their profiles, segment them into groups, and create personalized campaigns for them. You can also export their data for further analysis or use in other marketing tools.

Finding people in the CleverTap dashboard is a powerful tool for businesses to understand their users and create targeted campaigns that increase engagement and retention. For more information, refer to [Find People](https://docs.clevertap.com/docs/find-people).

# RFM Analysis

RFM analysis is a marketing technique that uses Recency, Frequency, and Monetary value to segment and target customers. It is a powerful tool for businesses to understand their customer behavior and create targeted marketing campaigns.

CleverTap provides an RFM analysis feature in its dashboard. The RFM analysis in CleverTap enables businesses to segment their customers into groups based on their behavior.

- **Recency**: This refers to the amount of time since a customer's last interaction with your business. Customers who have interacted with your business recently are more likely to be engaged and loyal.
- **Frequency**: This refers to the number of times a customer has interacted with your business over a specific period. Customers who have interacted with your business more frequently are more likely to be loyal.
- **Monetary value**: This refers to the amount of money a customer has spent on your products or services. Customers who have spent more money are more valuable to your business.

Using the RFM analysis feature in CleverTap, businesses can create segments of customers based on their behavior, such as loyal customers, high spenders, and dormant customers. These segments can then be used to create targeted campaigns, such as personalized offers, to increase engagement and retention.
