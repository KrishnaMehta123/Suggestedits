# CleverTap Dashboard

Before you begin using campaigns, check that Segment is integrated with CleverTap. Navigate to *Settings > Partners > Exports*.\
Review or enter your *Segment* account details. 

# API integration

Passing your Segment data into CleverTap can be achieved by API integration.\
Details about this integration are provided [here](https://segment.com/docs/connections/destinations/catalog/clevertap/#identify) 

> 🚧 Transformation of User and Event Properties when using Segment HTTP API
>
> Segment transforms user property and event property names when passing data to partners like CleverTap in the following scenario.
>
> 1. Send data to Segment from your servers using the [Segments HTTP API](https://segment.com/docs/connections/sources/catalog/libraries/server/http-api/), if this data is.
> 2. Send data to CleverTap using the [Server Side CleverTap destination](https://segment.com/docs/connections/destinations/catalog/clevertap/#server-side)
> 3. In this case, all event and user property names will be converted from '*sentence case*' to '*snake\_case*'\
>    Example :\
>    Data passed from sever -> Segment
>
> * "Industry Of Traits":" Hello World"\
>   Data passed from Segment -> CleverTap
> * "industry\_of\_traits": "Hello World"
>
> If the same data is being passed from multiple destinations to CleverTap, this will lead to the creation of 2 keys for every event and user property. We recommend using CleverTap's own API's to ensure data integrity.\
> More information on the CleverTap API's  [here](https://developer.clevertap.com/docs/api-overview)
