## Overview

Native Display provides the ability to embed content natively within your app screen without interrupting the app experience. It also provides the ability to change the content of your app dynamically and deliver relevant and contextual content to your users.

The native display campaign gives you the ability to modify sections of your app or show banner advertisements on live triggers and segmentation. This capability is available for iOS (SDK version 3.7 and above) and Android (SDK version 3.6.2 and above).
