# Overview

You can personalize the message for every user based on specific user property or event property values. For more information on user profile properties and events (dynamic replacements), refer to [User Profiles](https://docs.clevertap.com/docs/user-profiles) and [Events](https://docs.clevertap.com/docs/events#event-properties).

# Inline Personalization 

To invoke the personalization menu, type the *@* or the *{{}} *symbol in the title or the text fields while creating a message.

You can also add dynamic replacements in the title and body. Notice a preview as displayed below.
