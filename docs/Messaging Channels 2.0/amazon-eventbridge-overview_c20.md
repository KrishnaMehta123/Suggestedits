# Overview

CleverTap now enables you to send events to the [Amazon EventBridge](https://aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/) ecosystem. Events can flow from CleverTap via Amazon EventBridge to various other services such as AWS Lambda, Amazon SNS, Amazon SQS, Redshift, Firehose, and Amazon Kinesis streams.

After integrating with Amazon EventBridge, you can send the CleverTap events into any service in your AWS account.
