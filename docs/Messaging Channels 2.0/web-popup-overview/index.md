# Overview

Web notifications are pop-up messages that can be displayed on desktop or mobile websites.

CleverTap web notifications get displayed in two ways:

* In a footer of your site; available for desktop and mobile websites.
* Before the user exits your website, known as exit intent web pop-ups; only available for desktop.

> The prerequisite to set up web pop-up campaigns is to integrate your website with the CleverTap JavaScript plugin. For more information, refer to [Web](https://developer.clevertap.com/docs/web) in the developer documentation.

# Web Pop-up

Web pop-ups provide the capability to send quick alerts, offers, or even how-to tidbits to your users using our built-in web pop-up builder or your own custom HTML templates. The *Web Pop-up* feature makes it easy to set up web pop-up campaigns for all your users or specific user segments. 

These segments can be created on the basis of a user performing an action on one of your webpages, a user visiting one of your specific webpages, a user visiting your website via an external ad referral, or even based on the number of your webpages a user has visited so far. 

Once a campaign has been sent, you can view detailed reports on how many messages were sent, how many users converted as a result, and more.
