# Overview
In-App messages are a powerful channel that allows marketers to have contextual conversations with their customers directly on the application. These conversations come in different formats and templates to enable extreme use cases such as feedback surveys to simple ones such as a welcome back in-app for an inactive audience. They can be powered by simple texts, images, gifs, and even videos to make the conversation as interactive as possible.
