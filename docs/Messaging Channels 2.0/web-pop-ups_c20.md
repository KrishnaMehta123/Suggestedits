# Overview

Web popup messages are notifications that are displayed on desktop or mobile websites when a user is actively surfing a web page. CleverTap's Web Popup channel allows you to send quick alerts, offers, or how-to byte-sized content to your customers using the built-in web popup builder or your own custom HTML templates.

> 🚧 Prerequisite
>
> The prerequisite to setting up web popup campaigns is to integrate your website with the CleverTap JavaScript plugin. For more information, refer to [Web](https://developer.clevertap.com/docs/web) section in the developer documentation.

The *Web Popup* feature makes it easy to set up web popup campaigns for all your users or specific user segments. 

These segments are created based on either of the following ways:

* User action on one of your web pages
* User visiting one of your specific web pages
* User visiting your website via any referral web page
* Number of your web pages a user has visited so far in their session

After sending the campaign, you can view detailed reports on how many messages were sent, how many users converted as a result, and so on.

# Web Exit Intent

CleverTap’s web exit intent popups help with encouraging subscriptions or gathering information from users before they leave your website. CleverTap’s rich segmentation offers the ability to display time-sensitive, relevant, and personalized web popup campaigns on a large scale.
