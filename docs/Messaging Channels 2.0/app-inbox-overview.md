# App Inbox As a Channel

Push notification and in-app campaigns are great for grabbing the attention of the app user but they are short-lived. Once swiped off, they lose their ability to engage the customer. If the user is not online or is busy, you lose the opportunity to engage with them forever.

*App Inbox* provides the ability to send permanent content directly to your app from the CleverTap dashboard. Moreover, the inbox messages are targetable to individual segments such as other messaging channels. Your inbox can look different from the inbox of another user; the possibilities are endless.

# How to Get Started

To use CleverTap's *App Inbox* in your app, you must first go through the following steps:

1. Update CleverTap SDK to version 3.4.0.
2. Follow the steps for integration of *App Inbox* with your app. For more information, refer to [iOS App Inbox](https://developer.clevertap.com/v1.0/docs/ios#section-app-inbox) and [Android App Inbox](https://developer.clevertap.com/v1.0/docs/android#section-app-inbox).

Now, your app is equipped with one of the most powerful channels for engagement.
