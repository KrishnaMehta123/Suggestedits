#Carousel Message with Content
Carousel messages in push notifications show multiple images under one notification. It can be personalised according to the campaign run. For every carousel image we can put a new personalized message, according to the content. You can also add a link for each carousel message to navigate the users to that particular page.

##Use Case
Along with the advertising images you can add the related Headline in the message content along and use the personalization in these messages

#Carousel Message Without Content
Carousel messages without content can be made in an attractive way that can grab the users attention and also convey your motive of the campaign. You can add your promotional campaign creatives about your products as an image here without any text message. 

#Message with Icon
When you run a message with an icon app inbox campaign, unlike the “carousel with content” feature, here you cannot add multiple images. You can just add one single image in the given format along with any personalized or generic title and text that you would like to send to the users.
