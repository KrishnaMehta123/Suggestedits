# Overview

Email campaigns in CleverTap enable you to send messages to your users using either pre-built [email templates](doc:email-editor) or your own custom templates. 

You can send email campaigns to all your users or specific user segments. These segments can be created based on past or live user behavior, user properties, or a combination of user behavior and properties. Once a campaign has been sent, you can view detailed reports on how many messages were sent, and how many users converted as a result of the campaign.

> 📘 Integrate Your Email Provider

> Before you can start sending out email campaigns through CleverTap, you must first [integrate your email provider](doc:email-partners).

@SUNIL: WE MIGHT WANT TO REMOVE ALL THESE PRODUCT DEMO VIDEOS AS WE COME ACROSS THEM BECAUSE THEY ALL HAVE THE OLD UI.
