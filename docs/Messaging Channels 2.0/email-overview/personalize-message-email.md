# Overview

You can personalize the email title and message body for every user based on specific user property or event property values. For more information on user profile properties and events (dynamic replacements), refer to [User Profiles](https://docs.clevertap.com/docs/user-profiles) and [Events](doc:events).

# Message Personalization

To invoke the personalization menu, type the @ symbol in the title or the text fields while creating the email message.

You can also add dynamic replacements in the push title and body. Notice a preview of the available email as displayed below.

# Liquid Tags

Click the gear icon in the editor to open personalization options. 

Liquid tags offer great flexibility in composing your message. You can have fixed or variable values and change the look and feel of your message by using liquid tags.

Each notification is personalized to the receiver. 

```html Output - Liquid
Hello John!

Here is a special coupon for you: Gold4All
```

For more information on using tags, refer to [Liquid Tags](doc:liquid-tags).

# Catalog

Click the gear icon in the editor to open personalization options. 

A catalog provides the ability to personalize campaigns with dynamic information in messages from product prices to inventory levels. You can create a new catalog by uploading a file with one row for each item in your catalog. A catalog can be uploaded directly on the CleverTap dashboard via a CSV file that is generated by your inventory management system on your servers. For more information on Catalogs, see [Catalogs](doc:catalog).

# Recommendations

Click the gear icon in the editor to open personalization options. 

After you have uploaded a catalog, you can display personalized recommendations to your customers. Imagine having a rolling carousel displayed to your customers based on their personal likes!  For more information on recommendations, see [Recommendations](doc:recommendations).

# Constant event property

Engage the user on multiple actions and inactions. For example, person A added to cart white coat and person B added to cart blue jeans, but they both did not purchase the items. 

You can create a campaign for each product added to the cart or you can use a *constant event property* to personalize the campaign to each user that did not purchase the item. 

For example, you can map the *prod\_name* property of the *charged* event to the *product\_name* property of the *added to cart* event. You can then hold this property constant across both events. Based on this property, you can now personalize the message received by each user. Imagine having to create a campaign for each product added to the cart instead.  For more information on using a constant event property, see [Constant Event Property](doc:constant-property).

# Linked Content

Linked content provides the ability to personalize emails with rich and contextual data available outside of the CleverTap platform. With linked content, you can send messages with send-time personalization.

For example, you deliver food across different geographies and you want to personalize offers to each user based on the weather and on their location. The location can come from CleverTap personalization and the weather information can come from an API that provides the current weather. If you want to add more information, you can opt for any source such as third-party tools and in-house software to include in your message.

For more information, refer to [Linked Content](https://docs.clevertap.com/docs/linked-content#write-linked-content).
