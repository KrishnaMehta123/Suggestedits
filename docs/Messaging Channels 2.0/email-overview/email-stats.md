# Tracking Links in Email Campaigns

You can track the distribution of clicks on each link that you include in your email campaign.  For example, you want to send an email promotion for an upcoming movie on your video streaming app. You can create an email campaign and add links for reviews, promotions, movie merchandise, and so on, and then send the campaign.  We will record the clicks for each link in the email and you can see them on the Campaign Stats page. Open the email campaign from the campaign list page.
