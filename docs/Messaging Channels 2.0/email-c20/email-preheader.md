###Preheaders
Email preheader is the summary text that follows a subject line when the email is viewed in an inbox. If there is no Preheader text, the email inbox simply displays the beginning of your email text. It's a great opportunity to influence open rates positively.

After you have created the message from the what section, click **Continue**. To display Preheader in your message, enter the Preheader text in the Preheader box.

It is recommended to limit the Preheader text to 100 characters. The final message will show the Preheader text along with the subject and the sender.
