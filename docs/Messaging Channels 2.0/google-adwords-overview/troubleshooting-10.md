# FAQ

## While uploading the Google Audience list from Clevertap we are receiving an error Advertiser not Whitelisted

To ‘Whitelist’ your Google Ads account, you would need to get in touch with your Google Ads support team directly as CleverTap has no access to this. In the meantime, you can refer to the blog by Google Ad which mentions criteria to be met before you use ‘Customer Match’ as an upload option for remarketing.
