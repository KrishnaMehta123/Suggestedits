#FAQ
##How do we unsubscribe a user from receiving SMS promotions?
The Subscribe API provides the ability to set a phone number as subscribed or unsubscribed. This is important so that you do not send a message to your users accidentally unless they have explicitly opted for it. (Reference :https://developer.clevertap.com/docs/subscribe-api )
