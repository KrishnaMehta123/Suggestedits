# Overview

SMS notifications are brief text messages sent to your app or website users even when they are outside of your app. SMS notifications provide the capability to send brief communication to your users or links enabling users to download the latest version of your mobile app. CleverTap’s rich segmentation offers the ability to send time-sensitive, relevant, and personalized SMS messages on a large scale. 

> 🚧 Prerequisite
>
> The prerequisite to send SMS campaigns is to integrate your SMS provider of choice. For more information, refer to [SMS](https://docs.clevertap.com/docs/sms-partners) in the integration guides.

The SMS module on the CleverTap dashboard makes it easy to set up SMS campaigns for all your users or specific user segments. These segments can be created on the basis of past or live user behavior, user properties, or a combination of user behavior and properties. Once a campaign has been sent, you can view detailed reports on how many messages were sent and how many users converted as a result.
