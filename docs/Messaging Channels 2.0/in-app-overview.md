# Overview

As of October 29, 2018, we have released a new and improved in-apps with crisper message rendering capability which provides the capability to send in-app messages with images, GIFs, video, and audio. You can also do A/B testing on your in-apps.

> 🚧 SDK Version
>
> To use the template-based in-app campaigns, update your app with the CleverTap SDK version 3.3.0 or above.
>
> A/B test does not need an SDK update. You can still send an A/B test on any SDK (including version below 3.3.0) version as long as all the variants are HTML templates.
