# Overview
Web push notifications are browser-based messages you can send to your website users even when they are outside of your website.

# Introduction

Web push notifications provide the ability to communicate brief, yet important alerts to your users while CleverTap’s rich segmentation and powerful infrastructure can help send time-sensitive, relevant, and personalized push messages at scale.

The *Web Push* feature makes it easy to set up web push campaigns for all your users or specific user segments. These segments can be created on the basis of past or live user behavior, user properties, or a combination of user behavior and properties. 

Once a campaign has been sent, you can view detailed reports on how many messages were sent, how many users clicked on them, how many users converted as a result, and more.
