## Q. Is it possible to send a GIF in an in-app message?

We do support GIF within the interstitial in-apps for users whose CleverTap SDK version is above 3.3.0, and you can send the GIFs in the In-App campaigns by writing a custom HTML as well.\
Please refer to the below document for the aspect Ratio and Image Size Guide.\
