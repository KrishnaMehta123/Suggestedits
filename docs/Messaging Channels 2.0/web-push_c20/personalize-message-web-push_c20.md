# Overview

You can personalize the Web Push title and message body for every user based on specific user property or event property values. For more information on user profile properties and events (dynamic replacements), refer to [User Profiles](https://docs.clevertap.com/docs/user-profiles) and [Events](doc:events).

# Personalization

To invoke the personalization menu, type the @ symbol in the title or the text fields while creating the Web Push message.

You can also add dynamic replacements in the Web Push title and body to send personalized web push notifications.

# Recommendations

Click the ![Personlization](https://files.readme.io/d946c02-personalization_icon.png) icon in the editor to open personalization options. 

After you have uploaded a [Catalog](doc:catalog), you can display personalized recommendations to your customers. Imagine sending a web push notification with shoe recommendations to a user who recently added shoes to their cart but didn't purchase. For more information on recommendations, see [Recommendations](doc:recommendations).
