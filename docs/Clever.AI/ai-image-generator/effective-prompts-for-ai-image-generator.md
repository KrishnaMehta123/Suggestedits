# Overview

The AI Designer Agent creates brand-aligned images directly from your text descriptions. Writing a clear, structured prompt ensures that the generated image accurately reflects your intent, whether it is for a sales banner, event promotion, or seasonal creative. The model interprets your text as visual intent; it does not render exact words unless space is reserved for text. For example, a prompt such as "Add a banner area for 'Shop Now' in the bottom-right corner" results in a layout with a visual placeholder, not the words themselves.

This document helps you write prompts that get precise, visually accurate, and on-brand results.

# Writing Effective Prompts

Writing a clear, focused prompt helps the AI Designer Agent understand what you want to create and where it will be used. A good prompt explains the intent, the visual feel, and the layout composition, so the generated image matches your campaign purpose and brand identity.

You can follow this simple structure to describe your image idea in a way the Designer Agent understands easily:

### Define the Purpose (What You Want to Show)

Start by defining the intent of the image. This gives the AI the foundation for your creative direction, whether it is a product launch, a discount banner, or a festive greeting. The agent uses this initial instruction to determine the type of image to create (for example, product-focused, event-driven, or brand-awareness).

**Example prompts:**

* "Design a launch banner for a new credit card rewards program."
* “Generate a push notification image announcing a new mobile app feature.”

### Describe the Look and Feel (How It Should Feel)

Add details that capture your brand’s look and feel, mood, colors, and overall tone. Use adjectives that guide the image's lighting, energy, or emotional resonance. This helps the AI interpret the creative style accurately.

**Example prompts:**

* “Use warm, festive lighting with red and gold accents for a celebratory feel.”
* “Apply cool blue gradients and clean white space for a professional, modern tone.”
* “Add natural green and white tones for a healthy, fresh look.”

### Add Layout and Composition (Where Elements Should Appear)

Specify the structure of your image; where to place text, logos, or visual emphasis. This gives the AI guidance on framing and visual hierarchy, improving clarity and usability across campaign channels.

**Example prompts:**

* “Add a header and subheader for the main message.”
* “Include space at the bottom for a ‘Shop Now’ CTA button.”
* “Add T&Cs text at the bottom in smaller font.”
* “Place the brand logo in the top-right corner.”

  ### **Prompt Tips**

  The following are some useful tips when adding visual and emotional details to your prompts:

  * Describe mood or emotion (for example, warm, premium, playful, trustworthy).
  * Mention lighting or visual treatment (for example, soft light, gradient glow, high contrast).
  * Avoid mixing contradictory styles (“vibrant and minimal”).
  * Do not paste links or external URLs; attach or upload reference images instead.
  * Add audience or product type for fine-tuning.
</Callout>

**Combine All Three Parts for Best Results**:

* “Create an image for a push notification promoting a Diwali sale on home décor items at HomeStay. Show decor items on sale with up to 50% off.
  Use warm red and gold tones with soft festive lighting for a celebratory, premium feel.
  Add a ‘Shop Now’ CTA at the bottom and place the HomeStay brand logo in the top-right corner.”

# Ways to Generate Images with AI

You can generate on-brand images in multiple ways depending on your campaign needs. The AI Image Generator supports creating new images, editing existing ones, or using a reference image to guide visual consistency.

For more information on generating and editing images, along with step-by-step instructions, refer to [Designer Agent](https://staging.docs.user.clevertap.net/docs/ai-image-generator).

> 📘 **How Brand Kit and Prompts Work Together**
>
> If your prompt conflicts with your Brand Kit, the Brand Kit always takes priority to maintain brand consistency. The system applies settings in this order: **Brand Kit → Prompt → Filters**
>
> This ensures every generated image stays brand-compliant and visually consistent with your defined design standards.

# Common Prompt Issues

Refer to the following table for common prompt related issues, and how to fix them for best results:

| Common Prompt Issue                 | Why It Causes Issues                                                                                                                                                                                            | How to Fix                                                                                                                                                               |
| ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Vague Prompt**                    | The AI Designer Agent lacks clear direction for layout, tone, or subject. Short, generic inputs like “banner” or “sale” don’t provide enough detail for a meaningful image.                                     | Be specific about what you want to show. Example: “Create a festive banner for Diwali with red and gold tones and decorative lamps.”                                     |
| **Conflicting Brand or Tone**       | Opposite visual or emotional cues (for example, “vibrant yet minimal”) or color requests that differ from your Brand Kit confuse the AI and result in mismatched visuals.                                       | Keep tone and brand cues consistent. Choose one style, for example, either “bold and expressive” or “clean and minimal.” Ensure color choices align with your Brand Kit. |
| **Using URLs**                      | The AI cannot interpret external links or embedded design references from tools like Figma.                                                                                                                     | Upload or attach the reference image directly within the generator instead of pasting URLs.                                                                              |
| **Misunderstanding Text in Images** | The AI interprets your text as layout guidance, not literal copy. Only the text you explicitly include in your prompt will appear. If no text is given, the AI may auto-generate its own creative placeholders. | Specify exact words if you want them visible. Example: “Add the text ‘Shop Now’ at the bottom in a bold white font.”                                                     |
