# Overview

The AI Designer Agent creates brand-aligned images directly from your text descriptions. Writing a clear, structured prompt ensures that the generated image accurately reflects your intent, whether it is for a sales banner, event promotion, or seasonal creative. The model interprets your text as visual intent; it does not render exact words unless space is reserved for text. For example, a prompt such as "Add a banner area for 'Shop Now' in the bottom-right corner" results in a layout with a visual placeholder, not the words themselves.

This document helps you write prompts that get precise, visually accurate, and on-brand results.

# Writing Effective Prompts

Your prompt defines what the AI creates. Clear, concise direction yields faster and more accurate results. A well-written prompt describes what you want to see, how it should feel, and where it will be used. Every word you include helps the Designer Agent understand the subject, tone, and visual intent behind your campaign.

A good prompt:

* Describes the scene, mood, and purpose clearly.
* Mentions key elements such as product, color, emotion, or layout.
* Uses natural, concise language (no need for complex syntax).
* Complements, not conflicts with your **Brand Kit**.

You can follow this simple structure to describe your image idea in a way the Designer Agent understands easily:

* **Describe Visual Theme or Goal**  
  Start by defining the main purpose of the image. This gives the AI the foundation for your creative direction, whether it is a product launch, a discount banner, or a festive greeting. The agent uses this initial instruction to determine the type of image to create (for example, product-focused, event-driven, or brand-awareness).
  * **Example prompts**:
    * Generate a 16:9 promotional image for a weekend food delivery offer.
    * Design a launch banner for a new credit card rewards program.

* **Add Visual and Emotional Details**  
  Once you have defined the purpose, add details about the look and feel of the image. Mention color palettes, styles, lighting, and emotional tone. It is crucial because the agent interprets adjectives and design cues literally. This helps you control how your brand feels in the final output.
  * **Example prompts**:
    * Use red and gold tones, paired with glowing lamps, to create a warm and celebratory atmosphere.
    * Apply clean white and blue gradients with a modern, professional style.
    * Add natural lighting and fresh green tones to create a healthy, vibrant look.

> 📘 **Tip**
> 
> The following are some useful tips when adding visual and emotional details to your prompts:
> 
> * Include your brand or campaign colors for consistency.
> * Describe mood or emotion (for example, warm, premium, playful, trustworthy).
> * Mention lighting or visual treatment (for example, soft light, gradient glow, high contrast).
> * Avoid mixing opposite cues ("vibrant and minimal"). Pick one tone.
> * Optionally add audience or product type for fine-tuning.

* **(Optional) Include Campaign or Brand Context**  
  Finally, specify where and how the image will be used. This helps the model optimize layout, spacing, and detail based on the channel. This is crucial as the image for an email header needs different spacing and contrast than one for a push notification. Adding channel context improves framing, proportion, and usability.

* **Example prompts**:
  * Designed for a push notification banner promoting a Diwali offer.
  * For an email hero image introducing a new feature.
  * For a web push notification announcing a limited-time sale.

**Combine All Three Parts for Best Results**:

"Create a festive 16:9 banner for a push notification promoting Diwali offers.  
Use red and gold tones with soft lighting and decorative lamps for a warm, elegant look.  
Designed for a mobile-friendly layout with clear space for text."

# Ways to Generate Images with AI

You can generate on-brand images in multiple ways depending on your campaign needs. The AI Image Generator supports creating new images, editing existing ones, or using a reference image to guide visual consistency.

For more information on generating and editing images, along with step-by-step instructions, refer to [Designer Agent](https://staging.docs.user.clevertap.net/docs/ai-image-generator).

> 📘 **How Brand Kit and Prompts Work Together**
> 
> If your prompt conflicts with your Brand Kit, the system applies settings in the following order: **Brand Kit → Prompt → Filters**
> 
> This ensures every generated image stays brand-compliant and visually consistent with your defined design standards.
> 
> * **Brand Kit (Highest Priority)**: Defines approved colors, fonts, and visual tone. For example, if your Brand Kit uses red and your prompt requests blue, the system uses red.
> * **Prompt (Next Priority)**: Shapes layout, emotion, and composition within your brand style. For example, "Create a festive banner with gold accents" uses your brand-approved gold tone.
> * **Filters (Lowest Priority)**: Apply stylistic finishes like Cinematic or Minimalistic only if they don't conflict. For example, a Cinematic filter may deepen contrast but will not override your brand palette.

# Common Prompt Issues

| Common Prompt Issues | Why it Causes Issues | How to Fix |
|---------------------|----------------------|------------|
| Vague Prompt | The Designer Agent has no clear direction for layout or tone. | Be specific: "Create a festive 16:9 banner for Diwali with red and gold tones." |
| Conflicting Brand Directions | Brand kit overrides your prompt, causing mismatched results. Your Brand Kit overrides prompt settings, which may cause unexpected changes in color or tone. | Align color or style requests with the brand kit. |
| Overly Detailed Prompt | Too many instructions can cause the AI to split its focus, resulting in cluttered or inconsistent visuals. | Focus on 3–4 key aspects: purpose, tone, layout, and colors. |
| Using URLs | The model cannot interpret external links or Figma frames. | Upload or attach the image directly instead of pasting URLs. |
| Conflicting Tone Words | Opposite styles (for example, "vibrant yet minimal") confuse the Al's visual interpretation. | Choose one tone (for example, either bold and expressive, or simple and minimal). |
| Expecting Exact Text in Output | The Al interprets text as layout guidance, not literal copy. | Describe where text should appear instead of what it should say. |
