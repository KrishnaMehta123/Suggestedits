A campaign is a powerful tool to influence your user to action. A campaign comprises four parts:

* **Type**: The type of campaign that best suits your needs. Is it a past behavior segment where a user has already performed an action or a live user segment where a user action can trigger a response? 

* **When**: When is the best time to deliver your message? Is the message intended when a user does something or does not do something?  

* **Who**: This is the most important part of your segment. It is the intended recipient of your message.  You can group your users based on their preferences or behaviors. 

* **What**: What is the message that you wish to deliver to your users? Is it a simple message, A/B test message, or message property such as the preferred language.

A campaign must start with a goal in mind. What do you want to achieve through this campaign? For example, there may be users who almost bought a product by adding it to the cart but dropped off before completing the payment. You may want to nudge these users to action by offering a discount.
