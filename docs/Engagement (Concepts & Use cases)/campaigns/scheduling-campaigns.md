CleverTap provides you the flexibility to deliver your campaign when it is most effective.\
**Time zone** - Deliver the campaign in the user’s timezone. For example, deliver a message at 10.00 am to your user in Honolulu, Hawaii and then 6 hours later at 10.00 am in Washington, DC.\
**Campaign Do not Disturb (DND)** - Deliver the campaign after the DND hours or discard it completely.\
**Campaign Cut Off** - Stop messages from the campaign after the specified time.\
**Global Throttle Limits** - Set throttle limits to decide how many users will receive your campaign to use your system optimally. For example, if your system can handle only 20,000 of the 100,000 users that qualify for the campaign, then you can send the campaign in 5 batches. This is especially useful if you are running multiple campaigns simultaneously.
