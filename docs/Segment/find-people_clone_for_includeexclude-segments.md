Go to Segments > Find people

You can view detailed engagement statistics, demographic, device, and location information for those users. Inside your user segments, you can drill down into individual user profiles to see their detailed user profile and activity data.

You can also run targeted push, in-app, email, and web campaigns for these user segments from the Find People view.

##Include/Exclude Segments

You can simplify complex queries by including or excluding user segments. You can create powerful segmentation that is valid for a variety of scenarios. 

For example, you may want to offer discounts to all the users who have expressed interest by adding the product to cart in the past 30 days. However, you want to save your engagement dollars by excluding users who are already familiar with the product and use it regularly. 
The parameters for these users can be the following:
  * Users who have charged 3 times in the past 3 months, 
  * Users who have launched the app 15 times in the past 1 month
  * Users who rated a product 10 times in the past year

You can save all these parameters in a segment called "Regular visitors" and exclude them from the discount message. The new query will be

Another example can be where you want to include all users who charged in the last 30 days but also include users who rated the products in the past 60 days.
