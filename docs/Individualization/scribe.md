# Overview

Scribe is the first and only AI-powered writing assistant that can also analyze and adjust the emotional tone of your content. Scribe communicates with the OpenAI APIs to generate messages for you. You can use a few text [prompts](https://docs.clevertap.com/docs/how-to-write-prompts-for-scribe) to automatically generate attractive and emotionally relevant messages. It removes writer's block, allowing you to create message copies effortlessly and add emotional appeal to them. Scribe also uses emojis and hashtags wherever appropriate to generate appealing messages that help you drive engagement. 

# Create a Push Notification Message using Scribe

This section describes the steps to create a Push Notification message using Scribe. This feature can generate relevant copies for the message title and body.

To create a push notification message using Scribe:

1. Create a **Push Notification Message** using **Campaigns** or **Journeys**. 

   [block:image]{"images":[{"image":["https://files.readme.io/e0c88b9-image.png",null,"Create a Push Notification Message"],"align":"center","border":true,"caption":"Create a Push Notification Message"}]}[/block]
2. On the message editor, click the **Scribe**![Magic Wand](https://files.readme.io/18c307a-ScribeNewIcon.jpg) icon next to the _Title_ or _Message_ field.  
   The **Scribe** window displays.

   [block:image]{"images":[{"image":["https://files.readme.io/0287977-image.png",null,"Scribe Window"],"align":"center","border":true,"caption":"Scribe Window"}]}[/block]
3. Enter your text in the _[Message/Prompt](https://docs.clevertap.com/docs/how-to-write-prompts-for-scribe)_ field and click any of the following buttons to:
   - [Generate Copy](scribe#generate-options): Generate multiple campaign copies with varying emotions based on the prompt you enter.
   - [Optimize for Emotions](doc:scribe#paraphrase): Paraphrase and calibrate the emotional tone of the message.
     > 📘 Note
     > 
     > The maximum character limit for the _Message/Prompt_ field is 250.
4. Click **[View sample prompts](https://staging.docs.user.clevertap.net/docs/sample-syntaxes-for-scribe-prompts)** if necessary. This will provide you with sample syntaxes for writing effective prompts. 
5. To copy the generated content, hover over the message, click the **Copy to clipboard** ![](https://files.readme.io/8a9e8dc-CopyToClipboard.png)icon, click **Done** to exit the Scribe window, and paste the message. 

## Generate Copy

Based on the [prompt](https://docs.clevertap.com/docs/how-to-write-prompts-for-scribe) you enter, Scribe generates up to **three** message options. It also analyzes the emotional tone of the content. For example, you can enter _Give me a message with 30% off on Smart TV for Black Friday Sale_. The message is evaluated for emotions such as Anticipation, Fear Of Missing Out (FOMO), Joy, Surprise, and Trust. It enables you to understand how the audience may perceive the message. The emotional appeal of these messages can help you achieve a higher engagement. Based on the emotion analysis, you can select a message. You can also optimize the emotional tone of your generated message copy. For more information about optimizing emotions, refer to [Optimize for Emotions](scribe#generate-options).

## Optimize for Emotions

After you generate different variations of the current message, copy the one that best aligns with your use case and brand tone. Paste the copied message into the _Message/Prompt_ field, then click **Optimize for Emotions** to fine-tune the emotional tone of the selected message. Scribe displays up to ten options on the screen. Use the **Increase** drop-down to increase a specific emotion for your target audience. For example, enter the message _Black Friday Sale Alert! Get a Smart TV with 30% off now! Don't miss out on this amazing deal!_ and click **Optimize For Emotions**. If you want the message to evoke more _Joy_, it displays the messages with the highest _Joy_ emotion in descending order. You can click _Optimize for Emotions_ again to generate more options.
