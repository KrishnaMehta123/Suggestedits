If your catalog has new products that you want to add, you can choose to replace an existing catalog rather than uploading a new one. The entire catalog gets replaced with the new one, so ensure that you add the previous catalog products as well, if applicable.

#Replace a Catalog
To replace a catalog, perform the following steps:
1. From the dashboard, navigate to *Settings* > *Catalogs*. 
2. From the available catalogs, select the one to replace.
3. Click **Replace Catalog** and upload the new catalog from your system.

Once you upload the catalog, the new catalog gets validated on the dashboard. The dashboard status displays the status *Replacing catalog* which means that the new catalog is still not in effect. Until replaced, any campaigns will be sent with the previously uploaded catalog.
