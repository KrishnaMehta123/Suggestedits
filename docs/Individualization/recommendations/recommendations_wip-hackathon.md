Recommendations\
Overview\
Recommendations is a powerful lever for any marketer to have relevant conversions at scale, these are used to generate Retention loops within their User base by having personalised engagement for each user based on their past behavior.

What kind of Recommendations does CleverTap generate?\
CleverTap generates recommendations based on associations created via Collaborative filtering. The key idea behind Collaborative Filtering (CF) is that similar users share the same interests and that similar items are liked/purchased by users. How the users or items are paired can be explicit (based on ratings/likes) or implicit (based on purchases, views). Example:

In the above example, the left group can be recommended to watch House of Cards, whereas the right group can be recommended to watch Game of Thrones. Here, the similar pattern between the two groups is viewing Avengers and Captain Marvel.

Use Cases CleverTap recommendations solves\
Marc receives relevant and timely recommendations to purchase soccer merchandise as he recently added a pair of soccer shoes to his shopping cart. His list of recommendations would be based upon what other people interested in purchasing soccer shoes have been around this time of the year.\
Meredith has just watched Game of Thrones. Next, she receives an instant, in-app recommendation that suggests her to watch similar English drama series and other titles that are often viewed by viewers who also watch Game of Thrones. These recommendations are also sensitive to recent trends and patterns.\
Neha is working at her office location, it's about noon and she would be ready to order lunch from a food delivery application. She gets a notification at 1PM - best time of the User, mentioning the items based on cuisine she has had last time from a different restaurant within her delivery location.
