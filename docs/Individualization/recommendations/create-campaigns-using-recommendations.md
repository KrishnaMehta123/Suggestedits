## Overview

# Access Recommendations Within a Campaign

# Create Recommendation Content

To create recommendation content, perform the following steps:

1. Select a recommendation from a list of recommendations that have already been published and the event that you want to trigger the recommendation.

> 📘 Event Selection
>
> You can only select events you mapped to the catalog on which the chosen recommendation is running.

2. (Optional) Filter recommendations by event or by location: 

* Click **+ Filter by event**.
* Select whether you want to include or exclude an event and categories.
* Add more events if required. 

> 📘 How the Filter by Event Works
>
> The filter by event takes precedence over recommended items and selected events matching. It provides the capability to include and exclude all recommended items when an item in the product catalog column matches a defined event property.

* Click **+ Filter by location**.
* Select a product location catalog and a radius.
* Add more locations if required.

> 📘 How the Filter by Location Works
>
> The filter by location takes precedence over the location of the recommended items which are fetched from the location catalog. Items in a defined range are looked up with the associated product location catalog and matched with the user's last known location to be included in the filter.

3. Decide the sequence of items to be served up to the user out of the list of items that can be recommended (for example, serve up the first item from the list of recommended items).
4. Click **Create**.

> In case of Web Popup campaign preview, CleverTap does not support recommendations.

# Choose the Fields to Personalize your Message

Now that you have created a recommendation, use the following steps to finalize your content:

1. Choose the particular fields from the catalog that you want to use in your personalized message.
2. Enter your content in the title and message.

When the campaign is sent out, the fields will be replaced and the message will contain the personalized fields for each product. 

> 👍 Video Example
>
> You can send out a recommended video to the user with the video name and thumbnail image based on the last videos a user has watched.

3. Send a test campaign to yourself to see the look and feel of the campaign. The test message will show the first item in the recommendation list.
4. Once you are done testing, publish the campaign.
