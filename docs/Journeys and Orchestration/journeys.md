# Overview

With Journeys, you can craft seamless, automated omnichannel messaging experiences for your users using our intuitive Journey canvas. It is designed to guide users through a series of touchpoints, wherein each messaging channel delivers the most relevant content at the most relevant time, driving them toward your desired conversion. 

For example, you can automate welcome messages after signup, send timely reminders for incomplete actions (for example, cart abandonment), or celebrate user achievements with rewards. By aligning your communication with each milestone, Journeys helps you create meaningful interactions that drive conversions and foster long-term loyalty (refer to the following illustration).

# Advantages of Journey

The following are the advantages of CleverTap Journey:

* **Automates and enhances the user engagement experiences within the app**: By automating engagement workflows, apps can trigger in-app messages like personalized offers when a user adds an item to their cart but does not complete the purchase. This ensures timely and relevant communication.
* **Delivers personalized and omnichannel messaging experiences**: For example, a user browsing shoes on an e-commerce portal could receive an email with tailored recommendations, followed by a push notification with a discount code if they don’t act on the email.
* **Increases user retention**: By sending regular updates, such as reminders for unused loyalty points or upcoming app-exclusive events, you can keep users engaged and encourage them to revisit the app frequently.
* **Experimentation using[IntelliNODE](doc:intellinode)**: By using the IntelliNODE feature, businesses can A/B test different journey paths for the users. For example, testing whether offering a 10% discount versus free shipping leads to better conversion rates for abandoned cart recoveries.
