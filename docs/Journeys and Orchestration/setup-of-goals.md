Goals are behaviors that you want the users to perform. On completing a goal, users are removed from the Journey. You can drag and drop any segment from the left-hand side palette and add it as a goal for your Journey. A Journey can support up to 3 goals, if a user completes any one of the goals, they will be exited from the Journey.

## Common Examples of Goals 
  * Action based goals: In this goal, users will exit your Journey as soon as they perform a goal, in real-time. For example, exit people as soon as they perform the *Charged* event, where *item* is *Red Nike Shoes*.
  * Past behavior goals: Past behavior goals, like segments, are evaluated once every twenty-four hours, at 12:00 am. Once the goal is evaluated, users who meet this goal will not be a part of the Journey from that day onwards. For example, exit people if they have spent at least $300 in the past week.
