## Save Journeys

We have now successfully built a Journey!

Now that we have built a Journey, save it as a draft.

1. Click **Save Draft**.
2. Name your Journey.
3. Click **Save**.

    }

}

Once you save a journey in draft mode, you can make more changes to it at a later date or time. The other journey actions like _Archive_, _Stop_, and so on will not be available, as the journey has still not been published. The status on the _Journey Listings_ page appears as _Draft_.

When you are ready to publish your Journey and all the edits are complete, your Journey can go live. 

1. Open the Journey and click **Publish**.  
2. Verify the journey name. You can also edit the name here.
3. Once verified, click **Done**

    }
  ]
}

Once you publish a journey, you cannot change it except the _What_ section in an engagement node. All Journey actions like _Archive_, _Stop_, and so on will be available. The status on the _Journey Listings_ page appears as _Running_ unless you change an action.

# Journey Activation, User Qualification, and Message Delivery

Once you publish the Journey, it gets activated, users qualify, and messages are sent to the users based on the [Journey Entry Timeline](https://docs.clevertap.com/docs/setup-journey#define-the-journey-entry-timelines). Let us understand the process step by step:  

- **Activation**: The Journey activates immediately (**Now**) or **Later**. It applies to both multi-date and recurring Journeys.
- **User Qualification**: Users qualify for the Journey at midnight the day after activation. It applies to both multi-date and recurring Journeys.
- **Message Delivery**: Messages are sent to users starting from the night of publishing and continue as scheduled. It applies to both multi-date and recurring Journeys.
