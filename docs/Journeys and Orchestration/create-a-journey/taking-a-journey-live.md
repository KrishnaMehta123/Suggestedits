Once you save a journey in draft mode, you can make more changes to it at a later date or time. The other journey actions like *Archive*, *Stop*, and so on will not be available, as the journey has still not been published. The status on the *Journey Listings* page appears as *Draft*.

Once you publish a journey, you cannot change it except the *What* section in an engagement node. All Journey actions like *Archive*, *Stop*, and so on will be available. The status on the *Journey Listings* page appears as *Running* unless you change an action.

# Journey Activation, User Qualification, and Message Delivery

Once you publish the Journey, it gets activated, users qualify, and messages are sent to the users based on the [Journey Entry Timeline](https://docs.clevertap.com/docs/setup-journey#define-the-journey-entry-timelines). Let us understand the process step by step:  

* **Activation**: The Journey activates immediately (**Now**) or **Later**. It applies to both multi-date and recurring Journeys.
* **User Qualification**: Users qualify for the Journey at midnight the day after activation. It applies to both multi-date and recurring Journeys.
* **Message Delivery**: Messages are sent to users starting from the night of publishing and continue as scheduled. It applies to both multi-date and recurring Journeys.
