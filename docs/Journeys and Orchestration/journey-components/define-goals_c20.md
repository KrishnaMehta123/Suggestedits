#Overview
To achieve desired actions from users, you define a goal in a journey. For example, your goal could be to increase user registrations on your platform or want existing users to use your platform more frequently.
  
To define a goal, you can drag and drop any segment from the left-hand side palette and add it as a goal for your Journey. A Journey can support up to 3 goals, and a user exits from the journey on completion of any one of the goals.

## Types of Goals 
  * Action-based goals: In this goal, users will exit your Journey as soon as they perform a goal, in real-time. For example, exit people as soon as they perform the *Charged* event, where *item* is *Red Nike Shoes*.
  * Past behavior goals: Past behavior goals, like segments, are evaluated once every twenty-four hours, at 12:00 am. Once the goal is evaluated, users who meet this goal will not be a part of the Journey from that day onward. For example, exit people if they have spent at least $300 in the past week.
