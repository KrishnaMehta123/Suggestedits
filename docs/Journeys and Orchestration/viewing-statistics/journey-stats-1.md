The formula to calculate the boost rate is as follows: 

**Boost Rate** = (TG% - CG%)/CG% X 100

Where TG stands for Target Group, and CG stands for Control Group

As shown in the above image: (54.3%-18.15%)/18.15% X 100 = 200%

# Conversion Rate

Conversion Rate = (Number of Conversions/Number of Visitors) X 100

The trend section provides powerful insights about the Journey, such as:

- The users who entered the Journey
- The users who exited the Journey
- The users who met the specified goal
- The users who were timed out of the Journey on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis
