# Journey Stats

Click the **Journey Stats** tab. The *Journey Stats* page appears.  Select the *date range* from the calendar to display the Journey stats.

The *Journey Stats* tab shows you the combined statistics for the entire Journey. Journey ID is mentioned on the top left of the Journey Stats page.

All data except the user in Journey count, which is displayed on the upper right corner of the *Journey Stats* tab, are based on the selected date range.

The main stats are displayed at the top section that relates to the main stages of the user Journey.

The formula to calculate the boost rate is as follows: 

**Boost Rate** = (TG% - CG%)/CG% X 100

Where TG stands for Target Group, and CG stands for Control Group

As shown in the above image: (54.3%-18.15%)/18.15% X 100 = 200%

# Conversion Rate

Conversion Rate = (Number of Conversions/Number of Visitors) X 100

The trend section provides powerful insights about the Journey, such as:

* The users who entered the Journey
* The users who exited the Journey
* The users who met the specified goal
* The users who were timed out of the Journey on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis
