# Overview

A Journey is a visual campaign builder that lets you create omnichannel messaging experiences for your users. Journeys are ideal for engaging users across the lifecycle of your app.\
All journeys created have a Journey ID associated with them. The journey ID is available on the Journey Listings page, next to the name of the Journey.

To list a few sample use cases:

* Build user onboarding journeys that engage users over several days or weeks and on different channels as you educate them about your service.
* Build promotional journeys to entice your users to transact at different points in time.
* Long-running re-engagement campaigns to pull users back if they begin to slip away.

You can access Journeys under the *Messages* section of your CleverTap Dashboard. Click the **Journeys** link in the left pane in your CleverTap Dashboard.

Journeys have three steps:

* [Define a Goal](#define-a-goal)
* [Define Entry](#define-entry)
* [Define User Path](#define-user-path)

# Define a Goal

Here, you create a goal for your user journey. This is essentially the desired action for a selection of users on your platform. For more information, refer to [Define Goals](doc:define-goals).

You may create Journey goals like:

* User Registrations
* User Transaction
* User Re-Engagement 

# Define Entry

You want to check for certain user behavior to enable their entry to a journey.\
For example:

* Track new app installs to achieve the goal of customer registrations.
* Track type of usage on the platform to achieve the goal of enticing customers to transact.
* Track non-usage of the platform through events like uninstalls/account deletion/frequent guest use to achieve the goal of pulling users back to the platform. For more information refer to [Define Entry Criteria](https://docs.clevertap.com/docs/setup-journey#define-the-journey-entry-criteria)

# Define User Path

Based on the intended goal and entry, you may define various user paths for a customer journey.\
For example:

* Goal: User Re-Engagement.
* Entry: Users who haven't used the platform for more than 2 months.\
  *. Path1: Users who have uninstalled the app more than 2 months ago.\&#xA;*. Path2: Users who have the app installed, but have not used it in more than 2 months.
