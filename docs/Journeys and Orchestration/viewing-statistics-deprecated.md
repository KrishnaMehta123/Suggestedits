# Concepts

You will need to know some key terms to understand the Journey stats.

* **Goal Met:** If a goal is set in the Journey builder, these are all users who met the goal. 
* **Journey Timeout:** If a Journey timeout is set in the Journey builder (entry criteria), these are all the users who timed out.
* **Node Timeout:**  The qualifying window that is set for the node, after which the users will move on to the next node via Node timeout connector.
* **Completed:** If a goal is not set in the Journey builder, these are all the users who successfully reached the last node of the Journey.

# Overview

Click *Engage* > *Journeys* from the left side menu. The *Journey List \_page appears. Search for a journey and then click to open a Journey.  The \_Journey Canvas* has three tabs:

1. Build - Shows your Journey components and connections

# Node Stats

The Node Stats tab shows you the stats for each node. You can account for all users who entered the Journey and their current state.

Click the **Node Stats** tab. Select the *date range* from the calendar. The following shows how to check the statistics for each of the node types:

## Entry Node

This is the first node in the Journey. There can be only one *Entry* node.  An *Entry* node can only be a *Segment* node.

| Stat            | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| :-------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Qualified       | The total number of users who qualified for the journey. This stat is available only on the entry node.                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Entered Journey | The users who have entered a Journey via node connectors, such as Yes or No.                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Control Group   | The number of users who were marked for the control group. A control group is a set of users who do not receive any marketing campaigns. You can measure the effectiveness of your initiatives by comparing this group with the target group of users who received your campaigns. |

## Engage Nodes

Simply put, *Engage* nodes are campaigns. You can see the stats of each campaign from the *Node Stats* tab. Click the **Engage** node from the *Nodes Stats* tab to see the campaign statistics.

## Frequently asked questions

Q. Why do my users not qualify?\
A. Check if your user matches all the entry-level segments in the initial node.\
If it is an action, check if the event is from API. If yes, then check if you are passing the event in real-time or in batches. Passing the event with backdated timestamp will not qualify users in a live-action.

Q. What are last nodes?\
A. These are the nodes that do not have an output path. These nodes are present in Journeys without goals. 

Q. What happens to my users if my Journey does not have a goal?\
A. If you do not set a goal, the users from the last node exit the Journey. Their Journey is considered complete when they reach the last node. 

Q. Where can I see the users who are waiting because of delay or sleep defined between two nodes?\
A. You will see them on the following node under 'Waiting users'. 

Q. Why is the number of users on nodes not matching or adding up?\
A. The count of the users depends on the selected date range. If the original date range of the Journey does not match with the date range in your search, then the numbers will differ from the original. 

Q. How do I verify the number of users entering a specific node?\
A. The number of users moving forward from a node will always match the number of users who are entering the following nodes.

Q. Why my stats at last node are not matching?\
A. In the journeys created before Dec 27, 2019, You might see a mismatch of user counts or a drop in users. This is because earlier we used to have a dummy wait step post last node, where users will move and wait for goal to be met. In the new journeys (created post Dec 27, 2019), the dummy step no longer exists and this mismatch should not happen. 

Q. What is this intermediate stat on node stat?\
A. If you draw the same connector, such as 'Yes',  multiple times from a node and connect it to multiple Segment nodes, the users will move after the first action.  The stats for these Waiting users are displayed as an intermediate node on the connector.

Q. How will I see the stats for the Phantom node?\
A.  A Phantom node appears only when a *Viewed* or *Clicked* connector is drawn from an Engage node. The originating node will display the Sent count and the Phantom node will display the Clicked or Viewed count. For more information on Phantom nodes, see [Users waiting at Engage nodes](https://docs.clevertap.com/docs/journeys#section-users-waiting-at-segment-node).

The \_Goal conversion \_section displays the performance of the journey. You can see your influenced conversions here.  It also shows a comparison with the control group's performance.

The trend section provides powerful insights about the Journey, such as:

* The users who entered the Journey
* The users who exited the Journey
* The users who met the specified goal
