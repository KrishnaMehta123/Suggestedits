## Stop/Pause Journeys

You can Stop or Pause a published journey either from within the journey (top right corner) or from the Journey listing page.

* Pause will temporarily halt the qualification of new users in the Journey. You can use the same button to resume. Users already in journey will continue travelling through the journey or receiving messages. You can bulk pause or bulk resume paused journeys from the Journey listing page.
* Stop will completely halt the journey. A stopped journey cannot be restarted. It will stop the qualification of new users, any user movement within the journey, and sending out any campaigns. You can bulk stop journeys from the Journey listing page.
