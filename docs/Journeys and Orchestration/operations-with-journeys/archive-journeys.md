##Archive Journeys

Generally, Journeys are created with the same name with the suffix being the only difference. 
With an increasing number of Journeys over time, it becomes difficult to manage these Journeys. 
Archiving Journeys can help you to keep only relevant and latest journeys for your reference on the main Journey listing page.

To archive Journeys, follow these steps:

1. Click **Journeys**. The *Journeys* page appears and lists all the available journeys. 
2. Select the required Journeys and click the **Archive** icon <img src= "https://files.readme.io/fe9ec79-Journeys_archive_icon.png" height=“30px” width=“30px” >on the top.
