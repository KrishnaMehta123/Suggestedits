Journeys is a visual campaign builder that lets you create omnichannel messaging experiences for your users. Journeys are ideal for engaging users across the lifecycle of your app. 

To list a few sample use cases:
  * Build user onboarding journeys that engage users over several days or weeks and on different channels as you educate them about your service.
  * Build promotional journeys to entice your users to transact at different points in time.
  * Long-running re-engagement campaigns to pull users back if they begin to slip away.

You can access Journeys under the *Engage* section of your CleverTap Dashboard. Click the **Journeys** link in the left nav bar in your CleverTap Dashboard. Once on the page, you can click the **create** icon to create your first journey.
