## Save Journeys

We have now successfully built a Journey!

Now that we have built a Journey, save it as a draft.

2. Name your Journey.
3. Click **Save**.

Once you save a journey in draft mode, you can make more changes to it at a later date or time. The other journey actions like *Pause*, *Resume*, *Stop*, and so on will not be available, as the journey is still not published. The status on the *Journey Listings* page appears as *Draft*.

## Publish Journeys

When you are ready to publish your Journey and all the edits are complete, your Journey can go live. 

1. Open the Journey and click **Publish**.  
2. Verify the journey name. You can also edit the name here.
3. Once verified, click **Done**

Once you publish a journey, you cannot make any changes to it barring the 'What' section in an engagement node. All Journey actions like *Pause*, *Resume*, *Stop*, and so on will be available. The status on the *Journey Listings* page appears as *Running* unless you change an action.
