# Overview

IntelliNODE is a clever system designed to provide your business with the benefit of optimum engagement and retention. IntelliNODE has a wide variety of industry applications. You can select the correct messaging and a combination of messaging order, timing, and frequency. 

Following are the cases where leading different industries are solving their most interesting problems. Take a leaf out of their playbook to exceed customer expectations and increase ROI.

## FinTech

The Fintech industry has its own unique set of challenges with customer engagement and retention. While you focus on innovation and service for your customers, we can help you automate and fulfill your engagement needs.

Following are the use cases where you can test your approach:

<details>
  <summary><span class="bold"> High drop off during the know your customer (KYC) process.</span></summary>

### High drop off during the *know your customer* (KYC) process

KYC is a mandatory step before the user can make any worthwhile transactions on the application.  A high drop-off at this stage means a wasted acquisition.  

### Purpose

Find out the time of the day when the users are most likely to complete KYC.

### Assumptions

Users are more likely to complete KYC registration if they are engaged at a specific time.

### Experiment

Use IntelliNODE to set up different experiments to engage users at different times. If this is a weekday journey, create multiple paths to engage users, based on before, during, and after office hours. For example, create four different paths to send a push message at 8.30 AM, 2.30 PM, 6.30 PM, and 8.30 PM.
