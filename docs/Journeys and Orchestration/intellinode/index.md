# Overview

IntelliNODE is a powerful feature that allows you to experiment with and compare multiple journey variations within a single journey. It uses statistical analysis to help determine the winning journey and maximize your goal conversion. 

With IntelliNODE, you can compare up to seven paths for a journey. You can try different message copies, creative calls to action, delivery times, channels, or any other combination to determine the best journey for goal conversion. A journey can have up to 5 IntelliNODEs. You can create up to 35 (7 paths \* 5 IntelliNODEs) variants in a single journey, meaning you can run 35 experiments in a single journey. 

A simple example can be engaging a user who has abandoned a cart item. You can send a push message on the app informing the customer about the abandoned cart item and then a reminder message on a different channel such as SMS, Email, or WhatsApp to nudge the user.  Each channel may have a different reach and a different cost implication. Trying and comparing these different approaches can help determine the optimal way to reach the user.
