# Overview

Engagement Stats provide a unified view of how each messaging node performs across all versions of a journey, helping marketers make data-driven decisions.

For instance, a lifecycle marketing team may iterate on a welcome journey to improve user onboarding, testing different message sequences, timings, or channels in each version. With Engagement Stats, they can easily evaluate how each version performs in terms of overall engagement, delivery, and conversions, helping them identify the most effective strategy and continuously optimize user experiences across the funnel.

# View Engagement Stats

To view engagement stats: 

1. Go to **Journeys**. Click the desired Journey and click **Engagement Stats**.
2. Select the version from the Version dropdown to view the stats for the specific version of the Journey.

3. Drag and drop the columns to change their order. 
4. Click **Apply Changes**.

## Download CSV for Engagement Stats

You can export engagement data from the Engagements tab of a Journey as a CSV file. The downloaded file includes key metrics such as Engagement Node Name, Node ID, Campaign ID, Channel, Impressions, Clicks, and Engagement Rate. This is useful for audits, offline analysis, or sharing performance reports. 

To download the engagement stats CSV: 

1. Select the desired engagement nodes. 
2. Click the ![](https://files.readme.io/dc353d489783c14e9f6fbb342fbbe86b1f4fa7da36ec311e770d3be748d4d8d9-download_icon_png.png) icon at the top of the table.

The CSV file downloads automatically. All the columns displayed on the screen are included in the CSV file.
