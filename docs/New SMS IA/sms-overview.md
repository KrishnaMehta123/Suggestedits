# Overview

SMS (Short Message Service) is a low-bandwidth, device-agnostic text messaging channel that enables businesses to engage with users on any mobile phone—without requiring apps or internet connectivity. Its global reach and immediacy make SMS a critical component of any engagement strategy.

## Business Value of SMS

SMS enables brands to deliver time-sensitive alerts, transactional confirmations, and marketing promotions directly to users' native messaging inbox. It ensures high visibility and reliability, especially in regions with limited access to mobile apps or data.
