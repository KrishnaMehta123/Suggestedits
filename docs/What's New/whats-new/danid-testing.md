### DND in Journeys ![](https://files.readme.io/60aff92fd23c0779d2a6e2f55bf0a7804a52a145b6ded0b477ac5e82505ea224-Enhancement.png)

The updated DND feature sends notifications delayed by DND at their original scheduled time instead of right after the DND period ends. For example, a message was scheduled for 10 AM but was postponed due to a DND setup between Friday at 9 PM and Monday at 9 AM. The message will now be sent on Tuesday at 10 AM and not immediately after DND ends at 9 AM on Monday. This ensures a more controlled and user-friendly notification delivery experience.

You can now create variables to use in Product Experiences directly from the Dashboard, removing the need to sync them from the code. This allows you to integrate Product Experiences and build a proof of concept quickly. You can then share these variables with the developers to add the backend code later. It is a game-changer that saves you time and accelerates your workflow!

**Note**: Creating File type variables is currently not supported from the dashboard.

For more information, refer to [Create Variables from Dashboard](https://docs.clevertap.com/docs/remote-config#create-variables-from-the-dashboard).

### Personalize User Properties in Product Experiences ![](https://files.readme.io/0949e3bd996396f3fd7799fccec7f71c9c86e03c15d9b7e02f0ed2f1b0cffe64-Enhancement.png)

The trend line for Week 2 will be displayed as a dotted line so that it is easy to distinguish it from the Week 1 trend line. It helps create a visual comparison to quickly spot trends and differences across time frames.

### Notification Failed Event for Email Analytics ![](https://files.readme.io/0af5bff77142937aa8b7c49c3c7e320e4910325dbb00be9407e98700cb31de5f-Private_beta.png)

Announcing a significant enhancement to our Email Analytics: the *Notification Failed* event that gives you more deeper insights into campaign errors. With this update, CleverTap captures a *Notification Failed* event, along with the reason for failure, enabling better targeting and resolution.

* **Improved Targeting:** Target users through alternate channels when errors occur. For example, if users encounter soft bounce errors, you can re-target them via other channels.
* **Cleaner Email List:** Unsubscribe users with persistent errors to maintain an accurate and engaged subscriber base.
* **Error Analysis:** Analyze the root causes of errors to resolve issues and optimize future engagements.

The new Subscription Group Insights in Email Campaign Analytics will allow you to have a more granular view of unsubscribes by subscription group providing detailed insights, including:

* **Group-Level Unsubscribes and Resubscribes:** Track the number of unsubscribes and resubscribes for each targeted subscription group from your campaign stats.
* **Comprehensive Subscription View:** View the activities of the targeted subscription groups. Additionally, you can track any changes made through the Email Preference Center for other subscription groups.
* **Enhanced Analytics:** Understand user behavior better by analyzing how different subscription groups engage with your campaigns.
