To get to this view, navigate to *Boards* > *Mobile App*.

This view shows:
  * *Daily Active Users*, *Weekly Active Users*, and *Monthly Active Users* represent users who have launched your application at least once the respective *Daily*, *Weekly* and *Monthly* time period.
  * *Daily Paying Users*, *Weekly Paying Users*, and *Monthly Paying Users* represent users for whom you have raised the *Charged* event (or users qualifying as per the conversion event) at least once during the relevant time period.

This view presents detailed metrics on:
  * 1, 3, and 7-day *Retention*, *Engagement* and *Conversion* percentages, reflecting the percentage of new users who return to your application, meaningfully engage with your application, and convert into paying (or another conversion metric you choose) users, respectively, during the first 1, 3 and 7 days after first use.
  * *Daily Revenue* generated.
  * *Daily Paying Users*/*Daily Active Users (DPU/DAU(%)*) and *Daily Paying Users*/*Monthly Active Users (DPU/MAU(%)*) which measure the proportion of your active users who are making payments in your application (i.e., how good you are at converting users into paying users).
  * *Average Revenue Per Daily Active User (ARPDAU)* which gives a sense of revenue earned on a daily basis per user from your application.
  * *Average Revenue Per Daily Paying User (ARPDPU)* which gives a sense of average daily revenue from a paying user in your application.
  * *Daily Active Users*/*Monthly Active Users(DAU/MAU(%)*), also known as *Sticky Quotient*, which represents the percentage of your monthly active users who visit your application daily (i.e., how many of your active users are very active users).
