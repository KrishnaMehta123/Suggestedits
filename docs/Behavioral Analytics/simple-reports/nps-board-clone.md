# Overview

# What is NPS?

NPS is an acronym for Net Promoter Score. It is a customer loyalty and satisfaction measurement taken by asking the customers how likely they are to recommend your product or service to others on a scale of 0-10.

Aggregating NPS scores help businesses gauge customer satisfaction and improve upon service, customer support, delivery, etc. for increased customer loyalty.

CleverTap helps businesses  

The Net Promoter Score (*NPS*) dashboard provides you with a detailed view of the overall NPS feedback received from your customers. To view the NPS dashboard, navigate to *Dashboard* > *Boards* > *NPS*.  

# NPS Board

The NPS board represents the following data points:
* Overall *NPS score* 
* *Total responses received* from the customers

The overall *NPS score*  is calculated as the difference between the percentages of promoters and detractors (NPS = % of Promoters - % of Detractors). 

At a high level, the NPS feedback for a question is categorized into three buckets - Detractors, Passive, and Promoters. 

On a scale of 0-10 :
* A Detractor is anybody who gives a score between 0-6.
* Passive is anybody who gives a score of 7 or 8.
* Promoter is anybody who gives a score of 9 or 10.

Let us understand this with an example. For a standard NPS question such as “How likely are you to recommend us on a scale from 0 to 10?” If 70% of respondents are Promoters and 10% are Detractors, then you have an NPS of 60.

You can filter the data by campaigns or using the date filter.
