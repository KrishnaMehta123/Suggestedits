# Overview 

Device Crossovers shows you how many of your users started using your app on one device and came back later on a different device.

Some users may choose to view a product on their mobile devices, but ultimately purchase that product on their tablets, or web browsers. The Advanced → Device Crossovers View gives you an insight into this cross-device behavior of your users.
