# Overview

# What is NPS?

NPS is an acronym for Net Promoter Score. It is a customer loyalty and satisfaction measurement that asks customers how likely they are to recommend your product or service to others on a scale of 0 to 10.

Aggregating NPS scores helps businesses gauge customer satisfaction and improve service, customer support, delivery, etc., to increase customer loyalty. 

CleverTap's Net Promoter Score (_NPS_) dashboard provides a detailed view of the overall NPS feedback received from your customers. To view the NPS dashboard, navigate to _Dashboard_ > _Boards_ > _NPS_.  

# NPS Board

The NPS board represents the following data points:

- Overall _NPS score_ 
- _Total responses received_ from the customers

The overall _NPS score_  is calculated as the difference between the percentages of Promoters and Detractors (NPS = % of Promoters - % of Detractors). 

At a high level, the NPS feedback for a question is categorized into three buckets - Detractors, Passive, and Promoters. 

On a scale of 0-10 :

- A Detractor is anybody who gives a score between 0-6.
- Passive is anybody who gives a score of 7 or 8.
- Promoter is anybody who gives a score of 9 or 10.

Let us understand this with an example. For a standard NPS question, "How likely are you to recommend us on a scale from 0 to 10?” If 70% of respondents are Promoters and 10% are Detractors, then you have an NPS of 60.

You can filter the data by campaigns or using the date filter.
