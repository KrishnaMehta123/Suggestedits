# Overview 
This section covers how to analyze an event and its various components. Analyzing events provides the capability to understand your audience's behavior on a comprehensive level whether you want to view which countries use your app the most to what hours of the day they might stream a show. 

#Analyze an Event

1. From the dashboard, navigate to *Analytics* > *Events*. 
1. Filter by segments and select the event.
