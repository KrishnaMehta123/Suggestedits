In this view:

* New Users represent first time users in your app or website on that day.
* Existing Users represent users returning to your app or website on that day.
* Engaged Users represent users who have either viewed more than two pages/screens or have stayed on your site for more than two minutes.

The Dashboard → Today → Activity Stream tab shows some of the users who are active in your app, and what events are they undertaking.
