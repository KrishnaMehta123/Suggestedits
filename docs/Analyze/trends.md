Trend analysis helps you plot the occurrences of any event over time. 

Trends can be commonly used to: 
  * Understand patterns like “Video consumption is highest on weekends”.
  * Measure performance over time “The number of videos being watched is consistently increasing”.
  * Understanding the relation between the trend of events and users.

# Creating a Trend

To set up your trend analysis, you have to select the event which you’d like to analyze, and you can optionally further restrict your analysis to a specific property of that event.

        "#f6f7f8"
      ],
      "border": true
    }

## Advanced Filtering
Advanced filters allow you to restrict your analysis to a specific segment of users. Create a segment based on any combination of past behaviors in combination with any set of user properties.

# Analyzing Trends

## Overview
The trend result gives you an overview of your selected analysis in terms of overall events, users and, and the average number of events per user for your chosen time range.

        212,
        "#f8f9f9"
      ]
    }
  ]
}

## Event View

Along with the overview, you can also see a detailed time-series of your data plotted on a daily/weekly/monthly cadence.

        "#f5f8f8"
      ],
      "border": true
    }
  ]
}

## Property View

You can choose to plot any property instead of an event should you choose to do so instead of the event itself. 

### Integer Property
If you choose to plot a property where the data type is an integer, you will see a “sum” of the property plotted against the number of users that performed the event. This view is great to see trends in terms of “value of an event” that at times can be hidden behind the “number of events” that occur.

}

### String Property
Here, you will see a bar chart that will show you the contribution of any property to your trend analysis.

# Bookmarks
You can bookmark any funnel, cohort or event query and save it to quickly retrieve later. Bookmarks are specific to each logged in user. No other dashboard users will see the bookmarks you save. 

Bookmarks are convenient for recalling a specific analysis that you want to see frequently. For 
example you can bookmark you important conversion funnels and view them each day or week to see how they are changing over time.
