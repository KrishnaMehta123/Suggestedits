> While adding the card for payment, please note that:

# Recurring Payment Processing

Once the eMandate is activated, future payments will be processed automatically based on the billing cycle. Depending on your bank's processing time, payments may be deducted in real time or within 1-2 banking days.

# Troubleshooting

While setting up or managing eMandates, if you encounter issues, use the following solutions:

## Authorization Failure

If the card registration fails:

* Verify that the card details are correct.
* Ensure that the OTP or 3D Secure PIN is entered correctly.
* Retry the registration process or use a different card.

## Payment Failure

If a payment fails due to insufficient funds or technical issues:

* Re-enter the card details or use a different payment method.
* Ensure there are sufficient funds in the account for transactions.

> 📘 Removing a Card
