CleverTap for Startups is a self-serve program where we provide the [Basic Plan](https://docs.clevertap.com/docs/overview-1#basic-plan) for early-stage startups to understand, segment, and engage their users for increased retention, customer lifetime value, and campaign return on investment(ROI).

As part of the CleverTap for Startups program, we also have a community called [CleverTap Leap](https://clevertap.com/leap/). We partner with a global network of accelerators, incubators, venture capital firms, and businesses to provide exclusive benefits and discounts on the CleverTap Basic Plan to their portfolio or network of startups. Our partner program benefits both current and alumni-affiliated startups. You can find more details and check your eligibility for the LEAP Program [here](https://clevertap.com/leap/).

It is powered by [TesseractDBTM](https://clevertap.com/blog/tesseractdb-the-future-of-martech-is-here/), the world's first purpose-built database. This helps you pursue user engagement and retention, delivering incredible performance, lightning-fast data processing, and unlimited, secure storage capacity.
