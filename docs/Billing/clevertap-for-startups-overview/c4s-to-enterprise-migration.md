# Overview
Until now, CleverTap for Startup (C4S) users had to contact the CleverTap team to initiate migrating their C4S account to the Enterprise one. With a recent update, the C4S users can easily migrate to the enterprise plan with a self-served process without creating a new project/org in the CleverTap dashboard.

# Migrate C4S Account to Enterprise
To initiate the process of migration, write to the CleverTap team at [billing@clevertap.com](mailto:billing@clevertap.com)/
[sales@clevertap.com](mailto:sales@clevertap.com)/[support@clevertap.com](mailto:support@clevertap.com)/[selfserve@clevertap.com](mailto:selfserve@clevertap.com). Upon receiving the mail, the sales team will reach out to you to finalize the enterprise plan details and confirm the account migration to the Enterprise plan. After this, the sales team sends an email to the CleverTap billing team along with the following information:
* Your name
* Your CleverTap for Startup account ID
* Email ID of the salesperson coordinating with you

The billing team will schedule the cancelation of the C4S plan a day prior to the start date of the Enterprise plan. Based on your usage and discussion with the sales team, you will be assigned the appropriate enterprise plan. After this, you will receive an email from the billing team to initiate the actual migration process. Click on the link given in the email to start the migration process. On clicking, billing summary details display. If you have not incurred any overages, the credits to be added in your next invoice display. If you have pending payments or have incurred overages:
* **Default payment method is cards**: You are prompted to enter card details to clear the dues or overages. 
* **Default payment is eMandate via Netbanking**: You have the option of paying immediately via cards. 
 
(@Saurav/Saby: Should we show the calculation for CT X customers here? I think we should not. Want to know your opinion.) 

You cannot proceed further with migration if the payment fails. After the payment is successful, confirm the live and test projects that you may want to migrate to your enterprise account. As you move ahead in the process, the progress of migration displays at the top. After successful migration, you will receive an email confirmation. Also, your CleverTap salesperson will introduce you to your Customer Success Manager/Technical Account Manager/ Key Account Manager to onboard you to your Enterprise plan.
