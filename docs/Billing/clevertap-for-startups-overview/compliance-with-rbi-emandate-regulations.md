# Overview

With RBI eMandate regulations coming into effect from October 1, 2021, the processing of card payments for recurring transactions requires an Additional Factor of Authentication (AFA). This section provides information about recurring payment transaction workflow changes to comply with the new regulations.

# RBI eMandate Regulations

This mandate aims to protect customers from fraudulent transactions. To enhance customer convenience and ensure customer safety when using recurring payment options, the new guidelines mandate the use of AFA during registration and the first transaction, with relaxation for subsequent transactions of up to ₹5,000.

The card issuer sends a pre-transaction notification to the customer at least 24 hours before the actual debit. At this point, if the amount is higher than Rs. 5000, it would require an additional AFA to pass through. The pre-transaction notification also provides the flexibility to withdraw the mandate. To know more about the new RBI guidelines, refer to the following press releases:

* [Processing of e-mandate on cards for recurring transactions](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=11668\&Mode=0)
* [Reserve Bank of India extends timeline for processing of recurring online transactions](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_PressReleaseDisplay.aspx?prid=51353)

# How does it affect you?

The RBI framework requires that all the existing subscriptions must be re-registered via a one-time process of AFA. We are working with our payment partners to ensure that this transition is as seamless as possible. During this period, we are also ensuring that the services remain unaffected.

If the payment does not go through, we recommend you pay for the pending invoices from the dashboard. For any one-time payments such as MAU upgrade or Add-on purchase that requires AFA, we immediately take you to the payment partner page.

After successful re-registration, we would request you to approve any future recurring payments through the pre-transaction notification that you receive if the transaction amount is higher than Rs. 5000. This payment may take some time to go through, while the subscribed services remain unaffected.

We have also added a new payment method *eMandate via NetBanking* if you want to switch from card payment. For more information, refer to the [eMandate via NetBanking](https://docs.clevertap.com/docs/emandate-via-netbanking) section.
