The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has [imposed restrictions](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_PressReleaseDisplay.aspx?prid=51471) on American Express Banking Corp. and Diners Club International Ltd. from onboarding new domestic customers to their card networks from May 1, 2021. This is in effect for failure to comply with the RBI directive related to [Storage of Payment System Data](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=11244&Mode=0) policy.

Until there are revised guidelines from RBI, we are unable to accept Amex & Diners Club card payments.

There is no effect on other modes of payments, such as Visa and MasterCard.

We are working to resolve this issue. In the meanwhile, you may want to update your card to access uninterrupted services.
