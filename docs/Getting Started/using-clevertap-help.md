You can view the help topics by using the left navigation pane or search for information quickly from the help search box. 

There are two types of Table of Contents (TOC) in the help:

* The document-level TOC in the left pane. You can use it to navigate through the entire help.  
* The page-level TOC on the right pane. You can use it to navigate through individual headings on a page.
