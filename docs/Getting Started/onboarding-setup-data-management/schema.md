#Overview

Schema is a framework to maintain your data, organize, and structure it. It enforces rules to maintain data integrity so that you can avoid data quality issues later. Schema standardizes your data before you even begin using it. Since bad data leads to a high cost in effort and money, you can save a lot of manual effort on tracking your data in the long run.

To preserve data sanity, the schema table stores event and user properties in a pre-defined order. It ensures better output because it enforces standardization of the incoming data and avoids duplication or corruption of data. Better input leads to a better outcome in your campaigns and journeys. It also provides more accurate insights into your data analytics.

#Events

You can see your events under *Settings* > *Schema Events*. On this page, you can view all the events you are working with, along with editing or discarding to searching and filtering them.

The *Events* schema has four parts: 

 * [Custom events](https://docs.clevertap.com/docs/schema#section-custom-events) 
 * [System events](https://docs.clevertap.com/docs/schema#section-system-events)
 * [Conversion event](https://docs.clevertap.com/docs/schema#section-conversion-event) 
 * [Qualifying event](https://docs.clevertap.com/docs/schema#section-qualifying-event) 

#Custom Events

Custom events are events that you can define, edit, remove, and so on. These are your app events that you can fully control. 

1. Navigate to *Settings* > *Schema* > *Events*. 
2. Click the **Custom events** tab. 

If you have already defined your events, they are all present on this tab.

##Add Event

You can add an event from the *Custom events* tab. 

1. Navigate to *Settings* > *Schema Events* > *Custom events*.
2. Click the **+Event** button to add an event. 
3. Add the event name. This name must be unique in the schema.

[block:image]

      ],
      "border": true
    }
  ]
}
[/block]
For more information, refer to [Event Property](https://docs.clevertap.com/docs/schema#section-event-property).

##Edit Event
The name cannot be changed after the event is published.

1. Click the edit icon on the event row. 
2. Edit the event name.
3. Click the checkmark. 

[block:image]
{
  "images": [
    {
      "image": [

        "#f7f8fa"
      ],
      "border": true
    }
  ]
}
[/block]
##Set Data Retention Policy 

The data retention policy (DRP) retains an event for the specified time before discarding it automatically. Your subscription plan will decide the default DRP limit. 

1.  Navigate to *Settings* > *Schema* > *Events*. 
2. From the System Events tab, click the ellipsis on the event row and click **Set DRP**. 
3. Select *Custom*, then enter your specific time limit. 
[block:callout]
{
  "type": "info",
  "title": "CleverTap for Startups Limit",
  "body": "The default DRP for CleverTap for Startups users is one year and this cannot be changed."
}
[/block]
4. Click **Save**.

        "#9fa0a6"
      ],
      "border": true
    }
  ]
}
[/block]
##Remove Event
You must be careful before removing an event. If you ever need to remove an event from the schema, remove it from the event row on the *Events* page. You can only remove an inactive event from your schema; however, the effects are minimal because the event is not active. This action does not drop another event coming in with the same name. 

1. Click the ellipsis menu on the event row.
2. Click **Remove**. 
[block:image]
{
  "images": [
    {
      "image": [
        "https://files.readme.io/de2729e-Remove_Custom_Event.png",
        "Remove Custom Event.png",
        1215,
        448,
        "#f7f8fa"
      ],
      "border": true
    }
  ]
}
[/block]
After an event is removed:
  * The entire event row is removed from the schema.
  * If an event comes in with the same name, it is considered an undefined event.

##Discard Event

You can discard an active event from the schema. You can still see the event row in the schema; however, it will be marked as discarded.  
[block:callout]
{
  "type": "danger",
  "body": "You can only discard an active event. Exercise extreme caution when discarding an event because this action cannot be undone. This action has an impact on your schema because it purges all data for the discarded event. It also drops any future incoming event with the same name.",
  "title": "Caution When Discarding an Event"
}
[/block]
1. Click the ellipsis menu on the event row.
2. Click **Discard**. 
[block:image]
{
  "images": [
    {
      "image": [
        "https://files.readme.io/f7f15ad-Discard_Custom_Event.png",

        "#f7f8fa"
      ],
      "border": true
    }
  ]
}
[/block]
##Define Event

The events that are passed to CleverTap but not defined are marked as undefined events. You can define these events from the event row. Defining an event marks it as a recognized event in the schema, and therefore, when the event is received, this will not cause any error.

1. Click the ellipsis menu on the event row. 
2. Select *Define Event*, and a new window displays.
3. Click **Define & Save**. 
[block:image]
{
  "images": [
    {
      "image": [

        1212,

        "#f7f8fa"
      ],
      "border": true
    }
  ]
}
[/block]
##Publish Schema/Events 
To publish the events, perform the following:

1. Check that you have all the required events. 
2. Click the **Publish Events** button. 

All the new events flowing in will be validated against the new rules set. You will get a confirmation email.

      ],
      "border": true,
      "sizing": "full"
    }
  ]
}
[/block]
#Handle Undefined Data

You can handle all the undefined events simultaneously. 

1. Click the ellipsis menu on the right of *+Event*.
2. Select *Handle undefined data*.  The *Undefined data settings* page displays.

      ],
      "border": true
    }
  ]
}
[/block]
If an undefined event occurs:
* Allow event: The event can start recording data, even if it is not defined in the schema.  
* Drop event: If the event is not defined in the schema, then it is dropped.
[block:callout]
{
  "type": "danger",
  "title": "Caution",
  "body": "Exercise this option with caution. This is a powerful option to keep your data clean, but you may lose unexpected data. This action cannot be undone."
}
[/block]

If an undefined event property occurs:
This option is only applicable to defined events that have undefined event properties. 

  * Drop event: The event is dropped along with the event property.
[block:callout]
{
  "type": "danger",
  "body": "Exercise this option with caution. If a defined event records an undefined event property, then the entire event is dropped. This is a powerful option to keep your data clean, but you could drop an existing event if it starts receiving an undefined property.",
  "title": "Caution"
}
[/block]
  * Drop event property: Only the event property is dropped but the event is allowed.
  * Allow event property: The event property is allowed to start recording data.
