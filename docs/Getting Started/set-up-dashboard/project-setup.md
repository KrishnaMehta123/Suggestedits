A project can be an individual app, a website, or a product. You can choose to combine multiple platforms (iOS, Android, Web, etc.) in a single project or have separate projects for each platform depending on your business goals.

CleverTap automatically creates a *Test* project for testing after you create a project. You can perform all your tests on this project before you actually roll out the changes.

# Create a Project
After you log on to CleverTap platform for the first time, you can create a project. From the setup page, perform the following steps:
1. Enter a project name. 
2. Select the business category. 
3. Define the account timezone.

#Modify a Project Name

If you need to modify a project name later, the admin can do so and it will not affect the project in any other way except for the name change. To modify a project name, perform the following steps:

1. From the CleverTap dashboard, navigate to *Settings* > *Project*.
2. Click the pencil icon next to the project name.
