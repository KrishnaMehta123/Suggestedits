# Overview

A project can be an individual app, website, or product. You can choose to combine multiple platforms, such as Android, iOS, Web, and so on, in a single project. Depending on your business goals, you can also have separate projects for each platform. 

# Create a Project

After you log on to the CleverTap platform for the first time, you can create a project. From the setup page, perform the following steps:

1. Enter a *Project name*. 
2. Select the *Business category* from the dropdown. 
3. Define the Account Timezone. 

> 📘 What Affects Timezones
>
> Campaign delivery, Journeys, and scheduled data exports are based on timezones.

4. Choose from the following platforms:
   * Android 
   * iOS
   * Web
   * API
5. Choose the platform of your app. Select *Native* for native [Android](https://developer.clevertap.com/docs/android) and [iOS](https://developer.clevertap.com/docs/ios) apps. You can also select the other hybrid platforms for Android and iOS, such as:
   * [Cordova](https://developer.clevertap.com/docs/cordova)
   * [Unity](https://developer.clevertap.com/docs/unity)
   * [Xamarin](https://developer.clevertap.com/docs/xamarin)

## Create a Test Project

CleverTap automatically creates a *Test* project for testing when you create a Live project. You can perform all your tests on this project before you actually roll out the changes. However, you also have the flexibility to create additional test projects within a Live project if needed.

To create a Test project:

1. Navigate to *Organization* > *Projects* from the CleverTap dashboard.
2. Click **+ Test Project**. 
3. Enter *Project name*.
4. Click **Add**.

The Test project is created on the *Projects* page.

> 📘 Permissions
>
> To create a Live or Test project, you must have the Admin access.

## Edit a Project Name

If you need to edit a project name later, the admin can do so, and it will not affect the project in any other way except for the name change. To modify a project name, perform the following steps:

1. From the CleverTap dashboard, navigate to *Settings* > *Project*.
2. Click the ![ellipsis](https://files.readme.io/a581163-Ellipsis.png) icon next to the project name.
3. Modify the project name.
4. Click **Save**.
