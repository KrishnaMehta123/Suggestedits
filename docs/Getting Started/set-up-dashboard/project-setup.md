## Overview

A project can be an individual app, a website, or a product. You can choose to combine multiple platforms (iOS, Android, Web, etc.) in a single project or have separate projects for each platform depending on your business goals.

CleverTap automatically creates a *Test* project for testing after you create a project. You can perform all your tests on this project before you actually roll out the changes.

# Create a Project

After you log on to CleverTap platform for the first time, you can create a project. From the setup page, perform the following steps:

1. Enter a project name. 
2. Select the business category. 
3. Define the account timezone. 

> 📘 What Affects Timezones

* Android 
* iOS
