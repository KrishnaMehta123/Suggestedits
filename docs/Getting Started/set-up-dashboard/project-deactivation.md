## Overview

CleverTap allows customers to deactivate a project from the dashboard. 
This helps to:
  1. Remove the need for SDK release of the customer's platform. 
  2. Make the product more self-driven.
  3. Reduce manual efforts for customers and internal teams (Finance/Sales).
  4. Eliminate the ingestion cost that occurred earlier by deactivating projects manually from the CleverTap finance team.
