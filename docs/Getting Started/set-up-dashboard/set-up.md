## Overview

This section covers various information on the setup including the project ID and token, account passcode, timezone, two-factor authentication, and inviting other team members.

# Project ID and Project Token

A project ID and a project token are randomly generated alphanumeric numbers after the account creation process. The project ID and token details are required during the CleverTap SDK integration phase. 

# Account Passcode

An account passcode is required for pushing data to CleverTap via APIs or to fetch data from CleverTap. Only admins can see the account passcode details and have the ability to reset it. 

## Reset a Passcode

Admins should only reset a passcode only under extreme circumstances (e.g., credentials have been compromised).

> 🚧 Effects on Data Exports or Imports
>
> When the passcode is reset, all data exports and imports from CleverTap will stop. You will need to use the new passcode to ensure data exports and imports can continue.

To reset the account passcode, perform the following steps:

1. From the CleverTap dashboard, navigate to *Settings* > *Project*.
2. Click on the circular arrows on the right of *Passcode*.

3. Click **Reset**.

# Timezone 

During the setup, ensure you select the correct timezone for your business.

> 📘 What Affects Timezones
>
> The timezone selection should be based on the timezone where the majority of your user base is available. Campaign delivery, journeys, and scheduled data exports are based on account timezones.

To define the account timezone, perform the following steps:

1. From the CleverTap dashboard, navigate to *Settings* > *Project*.
2. Click on the pencil icon on the right of *Timezone*.

4. Click **Change**.

# Two-factor Authentication

At the moment, CleverTap supports two-factor authentication (2FA) via Google Authenticator as an added security measure.

## Admin View

To set up 2FA as an admin, perform the following steps:

1. From the dashboard, navigate to *Settings* > *Project*.
2. Enable two-factor authentication.

## User View

To set up 2FA as a user, perform the following steps:

1. From the dashboard, click on your avatar, then **View profile**.
2. Enable two-factor authentication. 
3. Download the Google Authenticator app.
4. Scan the barcode on the CleverTap Dashboard.

Once you have enabled 2FA, you need to enter the one-time password generated by the Google Authenticator app each time you try to log into your CleverTap account.
