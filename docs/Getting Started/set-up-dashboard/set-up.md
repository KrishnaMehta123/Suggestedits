This section covers various information on the setup including the project ID and token, account passcode, timezone, two-factor authentication, and inviting other team members.

#Project ID and Project Token
A project ID and a project token are randomly generated alphanumeric numbers after the account creation process. The project ID and token details are required during the CleverTap SDK integration phase. 

#Account Passcode
An account passcode is required for pushing data to CleverTap via APIs or to fetch data from CleverTap. Only admins can see the account passcode details and have the ability to reset it. 

##Reset a Passcode
Admins should only reset a passcode only under extreme circumstances (e.g., credentials have been compromised).

  "title": "Effects on Data Exports or Imports"
}
[/block]
To reset the account passcode, perform the following steps:

1. From the CleverTap dashboard, navigate to *Settings* > *Project*.
2. Click on the circular arrows on the right of *Passcode*.
