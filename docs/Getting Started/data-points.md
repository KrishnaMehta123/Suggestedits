<@DOCS: Docs to review later. @Sunil: we may want to delete this page because it's so small and instead, we could add to our existing Glossary page later: https://docs.clevertap.com/docs/glossary >

TO EDIT LATER - 

Data points - NOT IN THE GLOSSARY
A data point is an event, event property, or profile property update.
Example: A charged event sent with x event properties would contribute to x+1 data points. Similarly, 1 single profile update with multiple properties would contribute to 1 data point.

MAU - ALREADY LISTED IN THE GLOSSARY
A MAU is an end-user who has recorded one or more events in a calendar month. When tracking mobile apps and websites, a user who is active on both devices with the same identity token will be counted as one MAU.
