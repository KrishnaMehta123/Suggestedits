## Overview

Events represent individual actions that the users have taken throughout various parts of their user journey. 

# Examples

Some examples of events include when a user is: 

* Launching an app.
* Viewing a product.
* Watching a video.
* Sharing a category.
* Making a purchase.

Each specific action you want to track can be passed to CleverTap as an event. Custom events can be defined by choosing a suitable text string.

The following is an example of various events:

# System Events vs. Custom Events

System events are events recorded automatically after you integrate our SDK. Custom events are events you define and track with our SDK or API.
