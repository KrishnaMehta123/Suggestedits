CleverTap is a smart, all-in-one platform packed with engagement and real-time analytics tools that helps brands maximize their user lifetime value. The platform empowers marketers to build an amazing mobile experience in three ways: 
  * Tracks actions users are taking and analyzes how people use the product. 
  * [Segment](doc:segments) users based on their actions and run targeted [campaigns](doc:intro-to-campaigns) to these segments. 
  * [Analyze](doc:intro-to-reports) each campaign to understand their effect on user engagement and business metrics.

#Use Case

The following is an example of how a CleverTap customer in the retail industry is using our platform to increase sales:

When a person launches the company’s app for the first time, the CleverTap SDK automatically creates a CleverTap [user profile](doc:user-profiles) for the person. As the person navigates through product pages in the app, CleverTap logs these actions as [events](doc:events) associated with the user’s profile. 

The user’s interaction with the company extends beyond the app. To complete a purchase, the user contacts the company’s call center, and the company adds this purchase event to the user’s profile with the CleverTap [open APIs](https://developer.clevertap.com/docs/api-overview). 

Now, the marketer at the company wants to reward its most loyal users and incentivize them to buy more. Through the CleverTap dashboard, the marketer can [create a campaign](doc:intro-to-campaigns) to show an [in-app notification](https://docs.clevertap.com/docs/inapp-campaigns) to users who recently made a purchase above a certain price. The next time the user launches the app, they will see a personalized message thanking them for buying that specific product and a discount code for their next purchase. 

To close this loop, the marketer can create a [report](doc:intro-to-reports) in the CleverTap dashboard to measure the campaign's impact in terms of both user engagement and product sales. 

#Getting Started
