Using CleverTap you can create highly targeted and powerful cart abandonment campaigns. You can set up a message that the user will receive while they are in the process of abandoning your cart.

> If someone adds an item to your cart but does not transact within 15 minutes, you can send them a notification in this workflow.

# Step 1: Create a Funnel

Navigate to the "Funnels" section of your CleverTap Dashboard and create a funnel for the product/category you are looking to set up a campaign for. Check out this [guide](doc:funnels) to learn how to create a funnel.

# Step 2: Analyze the Funnel

Based on the example above, 41.6% of my users who added Toys to their cart, bought the toys. Of these users, 80% of them bought the toys within 10 mins

I should set up my abandoned cart trigger in CleverTap for Toys as a category with a delay of at least 10 mins. i.e. If someone adds toys to their cart and doesn't buy it within 10 mins, I should send them a notification since 80% of my users who bought toys did it within 10 minutes.

# Step 3: Create Campaign

Navigate to push campaigns ---> Live user segments ---> inaction within time.

You have now set up a scientific way to send cart abandonment messages!
