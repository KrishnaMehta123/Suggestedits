# Mobile Channels

**[Push](doc:push)**
Push notifications enable you communicate with your users when they are not in your app. These messages appear on a user's lock screen or in a top/bottom banner, depending on platform and user configuration.

**[In-App](doc:in-app) **
In-app notifications are popup messages that are shown to the user while they are in your app. While push notifications are viewed by the user outside the app, in-app notifications are viewed strictly inside the app. In-app notifications are great to show contextual messages, such as discount offers while the user is within the app, or to communicate with users who have turned off push notifications.

**[SMS](doc:sms)**
SMS notifications enable you to send brief communication to your users, such as one-time passwords to authorize their use on your app, or even links enabling users to download the latest version of your mobile app.
