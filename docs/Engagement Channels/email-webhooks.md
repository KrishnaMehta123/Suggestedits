# Additional Channels

**[Email](doc:email) **

In CleverTap, you create the content for the email, specify the target audience, and determine when the campaign will be sent. CleverTap delivers the email messages to the third-party [email service provider](doc:email-partners) of your choosing via a simple configuration in the Dashboard.

**[Webhooks](doc:webhooks)**

CleverTap webhooks enable developers to monitor specific user events and receive push notifications to their server when those events happen. The details of each user who qualify for the campaign are sent to the endpoint, which can be used to export data to a third-party system.

**[Facebook Audience](doc:facebook-audience)**

Facebook Custom Audience is a great way to re-engage with your users outside of your app through ads on Facebook. The Facebook Audience module on the CleverTap dashboard makes it easy to set up Facebook Audience ads for all your users or just specific user segments. These segments can be created on the basis of past user behavior, user properties, or a combination of past user behavior and properties.
