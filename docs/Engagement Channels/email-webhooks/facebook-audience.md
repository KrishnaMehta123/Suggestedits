Facebook Custom Audiences are a great way to re-engage with users outside of your app or website, via ads on Facebook.

The “Facebook Audiences” module on the CleverTap dashboard (under “Campaigns”) makes it easy to set up Facebook Audiences ads to all your users or specific user segments. These segments can be created on the basis of past user behavior, user properties, or a combination of past user behavior and properties. 

# Facebook Audiences Campaign Creation

## Step 1: Create a New Campaign
To start creating a Facebook Audiences campaign, first go into “Facebook Audiences” under “Campaigns” on the CleverTap dashboard, then click on “Create New +” on the top-right.

      ],
      "border": true
    }
  ]
}

## Step 2: Define the Who

The next step would be to indicate the target audience for your Facebook Audiences campaign. You can target your campaign to a user segment you create on the fly (by clicking on “Create ad-hoc segment”) or use a previously saved user segment (from the list of pre-saved segments shown in the table), as shown below.

  "images": [
    {
      "image": [
        "https://files.readme.io/2b56201-image2.png",
        "image2.png",
        1299,
        470,
        "#dfebf2"
      ],
      "border": true
    }
  ]
}
[/block]
If you choose to create an ad-hoc segment, you can now select a type of segment on which to base your Facebook Audiences campaign. The target can be created on the basis of past user behavior and/or user properties, as shown above.

For instance, we can choose to create an “Action”-based campaign that will target users as soon as they add a product to cart.

Here is how we would set up the “WHO”. You can add additional “DID NOT DO” and user property-based filtering, as well. You will also have an option to “Estimate Reach” to see how many users qualify for the campaign criteria and are reachable via Facebook Audiences as of now.

        "#f8f9fa"
      ],
      "border": true
    }
  ]
}
[/block]
## Step 3: Define the When 

You can set up the “WHEN” to schedule the campaign start and end, as shown below.

Past behavior campaigns can be scheduled to run:
  * On a specific date and time.
  * On multiple specified dates and times.
  * Recurring at a periodicity you set.

        "#f7f8fa"
      ],
      "border": true
    }
  ]
}
[/block]
## Step 4: Schedule Campaign

You can go on the next step that involves setting up the Facebook Audiences ad set to display to these users (if you have already integrated your Facebook Ads account). 

If not, you can go ahead and set up your Facebook Ads account as shown below, then choose the ad set of choice to display to these users.

        "image1.png",
        1296,
        228,
        "#eef1f4"
      ],
      "border": true
    }
  ]
}

  "images": [
    {
      "image": [
        "https://files.readme.io/0537c31-image3.png",
        "image3.png",
        384,
        168,
        "#eaeef2"
      ],
      "border": true
    }
  ]
}
[/block]
Then, you can continue to overview and schedule the Facebook Audiences ad to go out to your selected segment of users.
