Facebook Custom Audiences are a great way to re-engage with users outside of your app or website, via ads on Facebook.

The “Facebook Audiences” module on the CleverTap dashboard (under “Campaigns”) makes it easy to set up Facebook Audiences ads to all your users or specific user segments. These segments can be created on the basis of past user behavior, user properties, or a combination of past user behavior and properties. 

# Facebook Audiences Campaign Creation

## Step 1: Create a New Campaign
To start creating a Facebook Audiences campaign, Click on Campaigns -> then click on “+ Campaign" on the top-right and select "Facebook Audiences".

        "#f3f4f7"
      ],
      "border": true
    }
  ]
}
[/block]
## Step 2:  Define the When
You can set up the “WHEN” to schedule the campaign start and end, as shown below.

Past behavior campaigns can be scheduled to run:
  * On a specific date and time.
  * On multiple specified dates and times.
  * Recurring at a periodicity you set.

        2880,
        1344,
        "#f3f4f7"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
[/block]
## Step 3: Define the Who
 
If you choose to create an ad-hoc segment, you can now select a type of segment on which to base your Facebook Audiences campaign. The target can be created on the basis of past user behavior and/or user properties, as shown above.

Or you can choose from a list of pre-definedsegments

        2880,
        1344,
        "#f3f4f6"
      ],
      "border": true
    }
  ]
}
[/block]
## Step 4: Select the What

Choose which Adset you would like to export this campaign too.
This will ensure that we can get the stats for this adset back into CleverTap for you to see in the ClverTap dashboard.

        "Screenshot 2020-04-24 at 5.58.12 PM.png",
        2880,
        1344,
        "#f2f4f7"
      ],
      "border": true
    }
  ]
}
[/block]
## Step 5 : Define labels for you campaign
You can add specific labels for your campaign from a list or create new labels.

  "images": [
    {
      "image": [
        "https://files.readme.io/bbfeb2b-Screenshot_2020-04-24_at_5.58.17_PM.png",
        "Screenshot 2020-04-24 at 5.58.17 PM.png",
        2880,
        1344,
        "#f2f3f7"
      ],
      "border": true
    }
  ]
}
[/block]
Then, you can continue to overview and schedule the Facebook Audiences ad to go out to your selected segment of users.
