  ]
}
[/block]

[block:callout]
{
  "type": "warning",
  "title": "Note",

        "#faf8f9"
      ],
      "border": true
    }
  ]
}
[/block]
**Step 4: Build the In-app message**

        "Screenshot 2019-05-17 at 9.09.53 AM.png",
        1322,

        "#f4f4f5"
      ],
      "border": true
    }
  ]
}
[/block]

{
  "type": "warning",
  "title": "Character limit",
  "body": "The character limit for a message in English is 20 for the title and 75 for the message. The character limit for a message in Chinese is 9 for the title and 38 for the message."
}
[/block]
**Step 4a: Personalize Media**
Optionally, you can personalize In-App messages by using the 'personalized media' option. This option helps you to create recommendation In-Apps and also to upload personalized images for each of your user
[block:image]
{
  "images": [
    {
      "image": [
        "https://files.readme.io/4931315-Screenshot_2019-07-03_at_11.04.11_PM.png",
        "Screenshot 2019-07-03 at 11.04.11 PM.png",
        643,
        532,
        "#fbfbfc"
      ],
      "border": true
    }
  ]
}
[/block]
**Step 4b: Select on click action**

Mobile In-App enables various types of call to action (CTA) to cater to different use cases for the client. Here are the types of available CTAs:

1. **Close notification**: It closes the notification after a tap. 
2. **Open URL**: A special type of CTA that enables the user to open a deeplink for Android or iOS.
3. **Custom key-value pairs**: The key-value pairs send back custom data when a user clicks the inapp button. This data is not visible to the user. This feature is available for apps that use Clevertap android SDK version 3.6.1 or above and iOS SDK version 3.7.1 or above.

      ]
    }
  ]
}
[/block]
**Step 5: Pick the media for each orientation**
* Using the background option in InApps, you can choose the media that you want your end users to see when the app is in portrait mode and in landscape mode
* You can choose to add the same image with different form factors or completely different images to give a unique experience on portrait and landscape.

## FAQs 
####1. I need to send AB test and MV campaigns. Do I need to update my SDK?
