# Overview

The Web Inbox messaging channel enables you to deliver rich, individualized, and personalized web notifications to your website users. Using the Web Inbox channel, you can stack notifications sent to your users under a  notification window on your website.

A key benefit of using Web Inbox is that it enables you to deliver personalized web notifications to your website visitors in real-time based on the actions that the user performs on your website. 

Web Inbox also allows users to engage with the notifications later in time from the notification window. 

Including the Web Inbox channel in your customer engagement strategy significantly increases engagement and conversion rates.
