# Overview

Schema is a framework to maintain your data, organize, and structure it. It enforces rules to maintain data integrity so that you can avoid data quality issues later. Schema allows you to standardize your data even before you begin using it. This will save a lot of manual effort on tracking your data because bad data can lead to a big cost in effort and money. 

A schema table will store event and user properties in a  pre-defined order to preserve data sanity. It will ensure better output because it enforces standardization of the incoming data and avoids duplication or corruption of data. Better input will lead to better output in your campaigns and journeys. It will also provide more accurate insights in your data analytics.

# Events

You can see your events under Settings > Schema Events. All the events that you are working with are displayed on this page. You can edit or discard events from this page.  You can search and filter events from this page.

The Events schema has four parts: 

* [Custom events](https://docs.clevertap.com/docs/schema#section-custom-events) 
* [System events](https://docs.clevertap.com/docs/schema#section-system-events)
* [Conversion event](https://docs.clevertap.com/docs/schema#section-conversion-event) 
* [Qualifying event](https://docs.clevertap.com/docs/schema#section-qualifying-event) 

# Custom Events

Go to Settings > Schema > Events. Click the Custom events tab. 

Custom events are events that you can define, edit, remove, and so on. These are your app events that you can fully control. 

If you have already defined your events, they are all present on this tab.

## Add event

You can add an event from the custom event tab. 

To add an event  Go to Settings > Schema Events > Custom Events.

Click the +Event button to add an event. Add the event name. This name must be unique in the schema.

<Image title="Schema_Custom_Event_tab_main.png" alt={1182} className="border" border={true} src="https://files.readme.io/62b6153-Schema_Custom_Event_tab_main.png" />

For more information, see [Event Property](https://docs.clevertap.com/docs/schema#section-event-property).

## Edit event


The name cannot be changed after the event is published.

To edit an event click the edit icon on the event row. 

<Image title="Schema_Custom_Event_edit.png" alt={1196} className="border" border={true} src="https://files.readme.io/3fa0b42-Schema_Custom_Event_edit.png" />

## Set DRP

The Data Retention Policy (DRP) retains an event for the specified time period before it is automatically discarded. Your subscription plan will decide the default DRP limit. This limit can be changed later. You can set the DRP to a minimum of 3 months and a maximum of 10 years. 

To set the DRP for an event, click the ellipsis menu on the event row and set the DRP. 

1. To set the DRP, click the ellipsis on the event row and select Set DRP. 
2. Select Custom and then set the slider to the desired time limit. 
3. Click Save. 

<Image title="Schema_Event_Set_DRP.png" alt={1197} className="border" border={true} src="https://files.readme.io/182357c-Schema_Event_Set_DRP.png" />

## Remove event

You must be careful before removing an event. If you ever require to remove an event from the schema, you can remove it from the event row on the Events page. You can only remove an inactive event from your schema. However, the effects are minimal because the event is not active. This action does not drop another event coming in with the same name. 

To remove an event,  click the ellipsis menu on the event row and select "Remove". 

<Image title="Schema_Custom_Event_remove.gif" alt={1190} className="border" border={true} src="https://files.readme.io/299ea33-Schema_Custom_Event_remove.gif" />

After an event is removed:

* The entire event row is removed from the schema.
* If an event comes in with the same name, it is considered as an “undefined event”.

## Discard event

You can discard an active event from the schema. You can still see the event row in the schema. However, it will be marked as discarded.  

> ❗️ Note
>
> You can only discard an active event. Exercise extreme caution when discarding an event. This action cannot be undone. This action has an impact on your schema because it purges all data for the discarded event. It also drops any future incoming event with the same name.

To discard an event,  click the ellipsis menu on the event row and select "Discard". 

<Image title="Schema_Custom_Event_discard.png" alt={1185} className="border" border={true} src="https://files.readme.io/f54134a-Schema_Custom_Event_discard.png" />

## Define event


The events that are passed to CleverTap but not defined are marked as an undefined event. You can define such events from the event row. Defining an event marks it as a recognized event in the schema and therefore no error is raised for it when the event is received.  

To define an event, click the ellipsis menu on the event row and select "Define event". Click "Define and Save". 

<Image title="Schema_Event_Define.png" alt={1195} className="border" border={true} src="https://files.readme.io/2e440ef-Schema_Event_Define.png" />

## Publish schema/events 

Check that you have all the required events. You can then publish the events by clicking the Publish Events button. All the new events flowing in will be validated against the new rules set.\
You will get a confirmation email.

<Image title="Schema_Custom_Event_tab_Publish_events.png" alt={1172} className="border" width="100%" border={true} src="https://files.readme.io/16f841b-Schema_Custom_Event_tab_Publish_events.png" />

# Handle undefined data

You can handle all the undefined events simultaneously. To handle all undefined data, click the ellipsis menu on the Events page row select "Handle undefined data".  The "Undefined data settings" page appears. 

<Image title="Schema_custom_event_handle_undefined_all.png" alt={1191} className="border" border={true} src="https://files.readme.io/0fe398c-Schema_custom_event_handle_undefined_all.png" />

If an undefined event occurs:

* Allow event - The event is allowed to start recording data even if it has not been defined in the schema.  
* Drop event - If the event is not defined in the schema then it is dropped.

> ❗️ Note
>
> Exercise this option with caution. This is a powerful option to keep your data clean, but you will lose any unexpected data. This action cannot be undone.

If an undefined event property occurs:\
This option is only applicable to defined events that have undefined event properties. 

* Drop event - The event is dropped along with the event property.

> ❗️ Note
>
> Exercise this option with caution. If a defined event records an undefined event property, then the entire event is dropped. This is a powerful option to keep your data clean, but you could drop an existing event if it starts receiving an undefined property.

* Drop event property - Only the event property is dropped but the event is allowed.
* Allow event property - The event property is allowed to start recording data. 


> 📘 Note
>
> An error is reported for all actions. A drop will have a higher severity and allow will have a lower severity. For more information, see [Error Stream](https://docs.clevertap.com/docs/error-stream).
