The _Start here_ section displays the setup information. 

This section has the following parts:

- **Start here**: Check that the required platforms are integrated and ready for campaigns. 
- **Qualification criteria**: Deliver the notification based on _Past behavior_, [Custom list](doc:custom-list-segments), or _Live behavior_ For more information about segmenting users, refer to [Segments](https://docs.clevertap.com/docs/segments).
- **WhatsApp Service Provider**: Select the available WhatsApp service provider from the list.
- **Set a goal**:  You can track your campaign conversion by setting up a goal. Setting a goal allows you to measure your campaign effectively against what you want to achieve with the campaign. This selection is optional.

Define the conversion period by selecting the _Conversion Time_. You can define your conversion goal further by filtering an event by event properties. For more information on event properties, see [Events](https://docs.clevertap.com/docs/events).
