The *Start here* section displays the setup information. 

This section has the following parts:

* **Start here**: Check that the required platforms are integrated and ready for campaigns. 
* **Qualification criteria**: Deliver the notification based on *Past behavior*, [Custom list](doc:custom-list-segments), or *Live behavior* For more information about segmenting users, refer to [Segments](https://docs.clevertap.com/docs/segments).
* **WhatsApp Service Provider**: Select the available WhatsApp service provider from the list.
* **Set a goal**:  You can track your campaign conversion by setting up a goal. Setting a goal allows you to measure your campaign effectively against what you want to achieve with the campaign. This selection is optional.

Define the conversion period by selecting the *Conversion Time*. You can define your conversion goal further by filtering an event by event properties. For more information on event properties, see [Events](https://docs.clevertap.com/docs/events).
