You must indicate the target audience for your WhatsApp campaign. You can target your WhatsApp campaign to a new user segment by clicking on the **Target Segment** section. Here, you can create a new segment or use a previously saved user segment from the _segment_ list.

You can create the target based on past user behavior and user properties or live (ongoing) user behavior. The latter is helpful to send out real-time, triggered campaigns.

> 🚧 Delay > 24 Hours
> 
> We recommend creating a Past Behavior campaign for all campaigns where the delay is greater than 24 hours for a live inaction campaign.

For instance, you can create a live _Inaction within time_ campaign that targets users as soon as they add a product to their cart but do not finish transacting within 10 minutes; the golden window within which most users transact on online platforms.

### Deliver Action Based WhatsApp Notifications

You can trigger a WhatsApp message to users when they perform a specific action. This makes notifications more contextual and increases conversion. For example, sending a cab booking link to customers who have just booked a hotel or flight.

### Deliver WhatsApp Notifications based on Past Behavior (PBS)

You can also target users basis their past behavior. For example, you might want to target customers who have purchased a specific product in the past. 

### Filter by User Properties

Using the _With user properties_ filter in the _Who_ section, you can segment your campaign to reach users who meet specific criteria. 

For example, you can send a WhatsApp notification to all the customers from **Mumbai** who are currently subscribed to _Platinum_ membership.

### Targeting Cap

In certain cases, you may need to send a message to only a subset of the qualifying audience (_Target Reach_) for a campaign or avoid sending it if the number of qualified users exceeds the specified number.

A relevant use case is a limited offer where you want to send a fixed number of coupon codes you want to distribute. If the total reach for your campaign exceeds the number of coupon codes you can distribute, you can limit the number of users who will receive the message to exactly the number of coupons you want to distribute.

> 📘 Campaign Limit
> 
> Ensure that you set up a limit of 100 or more, regardless of the qualified user segment size. If the limit specified is less than 100, an error occurs.
