The WhatsApp message campaign needs to be scheduled to run actively for a specific timeline. To define the schedule for your WhatsApp campaign, you need to specify the _Start date and time_ and _End date and time_ under the _When_ section. You also have the option to start a campaign immediately by selecting _Now_.  Besides, you can also define a delay (by seconds, minutes, hours, or days) once a user qualifies for the target segment. Once you define the schedule and click on _Done_, the campaign will be triggered and terminated as per the defined timings.

### Delivery preferences

 In certain scenarios, you might not want a campaign to run actively on a particular day and time. In such cases, you can set the frequency for that particular campaign.

You can select the _Do Not Disturb_ (DND) hours during which messages from this WhatsApp campaign are prevented from going out, either by discarding them or delaying delivery after DND hours complete, such as 9 PM to 9 AM.  

If you want your campaign to adapt delivery times according to the user’s timezone, check the _Timezone_ checkbox. For more information, refer to [Delivery in User’s Timezone](doc:notification-delivery-options).

Additionally, you can check the _Cut-Off_ checkbox to avoid sending messages to users after a set cut-off time. This is important for time-sensitive campaigns, for example, live events.
