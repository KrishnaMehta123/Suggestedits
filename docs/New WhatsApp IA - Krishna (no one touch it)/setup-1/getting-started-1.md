To use WhatsApp as a channel for your marketing campaigns and customer journeys, you need access to the WhatsApp Business API.\
CleverTap currently supports no-code integration with the following partners:

* Gupshup
* Nexmo
* ValueFirst
* Exotel

If you have access to the WhatsApp Business API through a service provider that is not currently supported by CleverTap, you can use CleverTap's [Generic WhatsApp APIs](https://docs.clevertap.com/docs/generic-whatsapp) to integrate your service provider with CleverTap. 

Alternatively, you can request your service provider to become a supported WhatsApp partner by integrating CleverTap's generic API with their native messaging APIs using middleware.

By enabling your service (check for all such instances) provider with CleverTap, you'll be able to utilize all the features and benefits offered by our platform.

> 📘 Note
>
> To access the WhatsApp Business API directly through CleverTap, refer to the detailed [integration document](https://docs.clevertap.com/docs/clevertap-bsp).
