Once you have created your template, you can submit it for approval. It can take up to 24 hours to approve the template. After META approves your template, a notification appears in your WhatsApp Manager, and we email your Business Manager admins. In addition, we change the status of your template on the CleverTap dashboard. 

After the status is updated to approved, you can send messages to your users. Click the refresh button to view the latest status of your template.
