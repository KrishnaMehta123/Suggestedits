Creating effective WhatsApp templates requires adherence to certain guidelines. To increase the likelihood of approval and ensure impactful communication, follow these best practices

- **Keep it Concise:** Keep your template text brief and focused for clear and effective communication.
- **Eliminate Errors:** Avoid grammatical and spelling mistakes to prevent rejection and maintain professionalism.
- **Avoid Mix of Languages:** Stick to a single language within a template for consistency and clarity.
- **Choose Appropriate Message Category:** Align the template's goal with the selected message category for better categorization and understanding.
- **Use Placeholders for Template Personalization:** Contextualize template content with placeholders for relevance. For example: "Hey {{1}}, You've been pre-approved for our credit card! Enjoy an introductory offer of {{2}} via your personalized link: {{3}}."
- **Easy Opt-out Steps:** Clearly state how end-users can opt out of WhatsApp notifications, ensuring a smooth and respectful opt-out process.
- **Avoid Promoting Forbidden Business Verticals:** Steer clear of promoting forbidden business verticals to prevent template rejection and potential account bans.
- **Formatting Rules:** Adhere to guidelines on naming, size, and text formatting for template compliance and approval.
