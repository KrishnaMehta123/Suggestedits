> CleverTap BSP (Whatsapp Direct) users can select categories during template creation for Meta review, ensuring content alignment. This feature is specific to CleverTap BSP.  
> However, for external providers, template creation occurs in their WhatsApp provider's dashboards. Hence, template category selection is not available during template configuration in the CleverTap dashboard for external providers.

WhatsApp templates are divided into various categories, each serving specific communication needs. Understanding these categories and their ideal use cases is crucial for effective messaging.

## Marketing Categories

 WhatsApp provides the most flexible marketing templates. These templates enable businesses to achieve various goals, from generating awareness to driving sales. 

- **Awareness:** Introduce new products or services.
- **Sales:**Promote general offers, coupons, or sales events.
- **Retargeting:** Re-engage customers who visit your website or app.

## Utility Categories

Utility templates are triggered by a user action or request. They must include details about the active or ongoing transaction, account, subscription, or interaction to which they relate. For example, an order confirmation must contain an order number.

- **Opt-In Management on WhatsApp:** Confirm opt-in or opt-out preferences.
- **Order Management:** Confirm, update, or cancel orders with specific details.
- **Account Alerts or Updates:** Send important account updates and alerts.
- **Feedback Surveys :**Collect feedback on orders or interactions.
