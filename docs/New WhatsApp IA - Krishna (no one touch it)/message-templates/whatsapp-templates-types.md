# Types

CleverTap streamlines WhatsApp template creation by categorizing them into three distinct types, simplifying the template creation process for CleverTap users. The following are the types of WhatsApp templates, along with their features and use cases.

# Create

Creating WhatsApp templates is simple with CleverTap. The steps vary depending on the type of template you choose.

> 🚧 Template Approval Process For Customers.
> 
> - Customers using external providers (**WhatsApp Connect**) must create and submit their templates for approval in their vendor’s dashboard. Once approved, these templates should be replicated in the appropriate provider settings.
> - Customers using **CleverTap BSP (WhatsApp Direct)** can directly create and submit their template in CleverTap dashboard. New Templates will be automatically submitted to Meta and status will also be updated automatically.

> 📘 Template Categorization in CleverTap
> 
> CleverTap organizes templates into **Basic**, **Limited-Time Offer (LTO**), and **Carousel** for easier use. Your vendor's dashboard might categorize them differently, but you can still use them effectively by following CleverTap's guidelines.
